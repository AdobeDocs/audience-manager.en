## TOC

+ `TOC.md` at the root of the user guide provides the organization of the topics that are contained in the guide for this solution. 
+ Each user guide will have it's own unique `TOC.md`, in which you can order all the pages/topics as necessary.
+ The first page of all user guides is `overview.md`.

## User Guide

+ The introduction to the user guide is called `overview.md`
+ Each topic in the user guide has it's own distinct directory.
    + If there is a topic in the guide called *Implementation*, the corresponding directory is `/implementation`
+ All image assets are stored in `/assets` at the root of the user guide.
    + All images in the `/assets` directory will be localized.
    + Any images in the `/no-localize` directory will not be localized (there's a surprise!). This can be used to ensure in loc versions that specific assets aren't reproduced unnecessarily.

## User Guide Level Meta Data

+ Meta data which describes the user guide is stored in the `TOC.md`. This includes:
    + product - name of product/capability.
    + cloud - cloud to which this product belongs.
