# Trait-to-Trait Overlap Report{#trait-to-trait-overlap-report}

Returns data on the number of unique users shared among all your first and third-party traits.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Overlap reports in Audience Manager adhere to RBAC principles. You can only see traits from data sources that you have access to based on the [RBAC User Group](/help/using/features/administration/administration-overview.md) that you belong to.

## Overview

The [!UICONTROL Trait-to-Trait Overlap] report returns data on the % of unique users shared between all your own traits and your third-party traits. As an optimization tool, this report helps you:

* Create segments with high or low overlap, depending on your needs. Traits with high overlap give you a targeted audience, but fewer unique visitors. Traits with low overlap can be useful to reach a larger, unique visitor set. 
* Validate third-party trait data: Strong overlap between similar first and third-party traits suggests that the trait from your data partner is accurate and trustworthy. Conversely, low overlap can indicate that a third-party trait may not actually contain the same information as your own, similar first-party trait. 
* Find unexpected overlap between traits and use that information to build innovative segments.

>Folder traits are not available for comparison within trait-to-trait overlap reports. By creating a segment utilizing a particular folder trait, you can perform analysis via the [segment-to-segment overlap](help/using/reporting/dynamic-reports/segment-trait-overlap-report.md) report.
