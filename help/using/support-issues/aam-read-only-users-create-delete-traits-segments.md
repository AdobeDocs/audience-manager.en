# Why are our Read-Only users able to create, edit or delete traits and segments?

**Question**

Why are our Read-Only users able to create, edit or delete traits and segments?

**Answer**

On top of creating groups and permissions in the administration section, you need to contact Customer Care (amsupport@adobe.com) so a representative can enable Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) for your account.
