## Question

Why are our Read-Only users able to create, edit or delete traits and segments?

## Answer

On top of creating groups and permissions in the administration section, you need to contact Customer Care (`amsupport@adobe.com`) so a representative can enable [Role Based Access Controls (RBAC)](../features/administration/administration-overview.md) for your account.
