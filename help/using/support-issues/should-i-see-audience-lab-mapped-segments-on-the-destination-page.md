# Should I see my Audience Manager Audience Lab mapped segments on the destination view page?{#Should I see my Audience Manager Audience Lab mapped segments on the destination view page?}

## Question

I have some test segments created in the Audience Manager Audience Lab, and have mapped them to my destination.  When I look for them on the destination view page, however, I don't see them.  Is this behavior expected, or is this a bug?

## Answer

Segments that are created within Audience Lab, while able to be mapped to a destination, are not listed as being mapped to that destination on the destination view page.

For example, I have created "Test Segment 1" and "Test Segment 2" and have mapped them to the destination "autofill SID - serialized".  These mappings show up in the Audience Lab segment test that I set up:

These segments will not, however, show up in the actual destination view:
