# Documentation Updates 2019 {#documentation-updates}

A list of new or revised documentation released in 2019. Includes minor updates to the Audience Manager documentation that might not be covered in the Experience Cloud release notes.

See the [Experience Cloud Release Notes](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/whatsnew/) for changes to [!DNL Audience Manager] and other [!DNL Experience Cloud] solutions. See the [Previous Years](../docs-updates/docs-2018.md) section for older release notes.

## March, 2019 {#aam-march-updates}

| Topic | Description |
|--- |----|
| [Global Data Sources](../features/global-data-sources.md) | Global data sources are accessible by all Audience Manager customers and contain device advertising IDs generated by device manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Roku, and Android device manufacturers. These IDs are made available by manufacturers for advertising purposes. You can use global data sources to synchronize device IDs and import or export data keyed off of those mappings. Audience Manager validates the device advertising IDs (DAID) imported by customers, based on their format, to ensure they match the standard format outlined by device manufacturers. |
| [ID Mapping Limits](../features/administration/usage-limits.md#id-mapping-limits) |We have improved segmentation, reporting, and exporting of segments by limiting the number of cross-device ID mappings associated to a device ID. The newly imposed limits help us mitigate the impact that incorrect integrations and inaccurate data sets may have on ingestion and downstream processing. <br/> The new limits are: <ul><li>100 device IDs per cross-device ID</li><li>10 cross-device IDs per device ID</li><li>1000 device IDs to 1 device ID</li></ul> |

## February, 2019 {#aam-february-updates}

| Topic | Description |
|--- |----|
| [Trait Recommendations](../features/segments/trait-recommendations.md) | With Trait Recommendations, when you build or edit a segment in [Segment Builder](../features/segments/segment-builder.md), you get recommendations on additional traits you can include, that are similar to the traits in the segment rule. Add the recommended traits to your segment to increase your target audience. |

## January, 2019 {#aam-january-updates}

| Topic | Description |
|--- |----|
