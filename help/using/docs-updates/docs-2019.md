|[California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Support and Privacy Documentation Overhaul](../overview/data-security-and-privacy/data-privacy.md)| The [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://www.caprivacy.org/about), going into effect on January 1st, 2020, will provide California residents new rights regarding their personal information and will impose data protection responsibilities on certain entities that conduct business in California. <br> <br> Audience Manager helps you comply with your obligations under privacy regulations, through privacy tools like the [Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/services/privacy-service.html) for data access and delete requests. <br><br> We have updated the current [opt-out management](../overview/data-security-and-privacy/data-privacy-requests.md#opt-out-requests) process to include opting out of any declared ID (e.g. CRM ID). In case of opt-out by declared ID, the declared ID and the last linked device will be opted out of Audience Manager data collection. Opt-out requests now also send unsegment requests to [destination partners](../overview/data-security-and-privacy/assets/AAM-Partners-October2019.xlsx) who support this feature, both in batch and real time. <br><br> Additionally, we've redesigned our [Data Security](../overview/data-security-and-privacy/data-security.md), [Data Privacy](../overview/data-security-and-privacy/data-privacy.md), and [Data Governance](../overview/data-security-and-privacy/data-governance.md) documentation, to make it easier for you to find the information required to comply with the aforementioned regulations.|

| [Global Data Sources](../features/global-data-sources.md) | Global data sources are accessible by all Audience Manager customers and contain device advertising IDs generated by device manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Roku, and Android device manufacturers. These IDs are made available by manufacturers for advertising purposes. You can use global data sources to synchronize device IDs and import or export data keyed off of those mappings. Audience Manager validates the device advertising IDs (DAID) imported by customers, based on their format, to ensure they match the standard format outlined by device manufacturers. |
| [ID Mapping Limits](../features/administration/usage-limits.md#id-mapping-limits) |We have improved segmentation, reporting, and exporting of segments by limiting the number of cross-device ID mappings associated to a device ID.
