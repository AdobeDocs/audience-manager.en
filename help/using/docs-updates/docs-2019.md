| [Global Data Sources](../features/global-data-sources.md) | Global data sources are accessible by all Audience Manager customers and contain device advertising IDs generated by device manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Roku, and Android device manufacturers. These IDs are made available by manufacturers for advertising purposes. You can use global data sources to synchronize device IDs and import or export data keyed off of those mappings. Audience Manager validates the device advertising IDs (DAID) imported by customers, based on their format, to ensure they match the standard format outlined by device manufacturers. |
