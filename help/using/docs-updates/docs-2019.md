See the [Experience Cloud Release Notes](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/whatsnew/) for changes to [!DNL Audience Manager] and other [!DNL Experience Cloud] solutions. See the [Previous Years](../docs-updates/docs-2018.md) section for older release notes.

## May, 2019 {#aam-may-updates}

| Topic | Description |
|--- |----|
| [Create a Cross-Device Data Source](/help/using/features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rules-start.md#settings) | We introduced a new control in the workflow to create or edit a cross-device data source, **Data Retention for inactive Customer IDs**. You can now set the data retention period for inactive Customer IDs, determining how long Audience Manager keeps Customer IDs in our database after they were last seen on the Audience Manager platform.|
| [Usage Limits](/help/using/features/administration/usage-limits.md) | We have updated the way Audience Manager treats the algorithmic models limit. Audience Manager now only counts *active* algorithmic models against the limit. |
| [Custom Partner Integrations](/help/using/integration/sending-audience-data/custom-partner-integrations.md) | This page lists custom integrations between Audience Manager and data partners. <br>&nbsp;Oracle Data Cloud - Audience Manager ingests cookie and mobile ID data from the Oracle Data Cloud for Audience Marketplace via inbound data files. The custom integration specifications described in this page refer only to inbound data files that contain mobile IDs (IDFA and Android Device IDs).|

## April, 2019 {#aam-april-updates}

| Topic | Description |
|--- |----|
| [IP Address Obfuscation](/help/using/features/administration/ip-obfuscation.md) | Your company may desire to obfuscate IP address in many countries due to global privacy regulations. Audience Manager allows you to obfuscate visitor IP addresses on a global or country-by-country basis. |
| [Facebook WCA Integration](/help/using/integration/integrating-third-party/facebook-wca-integration.md) | This page illustrates the process of creating Facebook Website Custom Audiences (WCA) pixels for the purposes of sending web-based Audience Manager audience segments to Facebook, for online ad targeting with improved transparency. |
| [Audience Manager Plug-in for IAB TCF](/help/using/overview/aam-gdpr/aam-iab-plugin.md) | An important aspect in the privacy obligations you have towards your users is the acquisition and conveyance of user choices over how their personal data may be used (i.e., “purposes”) and by whom (i.e., “companies”). Adobe provides you with the means to manage and communicate your users' privacy choices through the [Opt-in functionality](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/overview.html) and through [IAB Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF)](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/gdpr-transparency-and-consent-framework/) support. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; This article describes the Audience Manager use cases that support the IAB TCF and how to implement IAB TCF support in Audience Manager.|

## March, 2019 {#aam-march-updates}

| Topic | Description |
|--- |----|
| [Global Data Sources](../features/global-data-sources.md) | Global data sources are accessible by all Audience Manager customers and contain device advertising IDs generated by device manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Roku, and Android device manufacturers. These IDs are made available by manufacturers for advertising purposes. You can use global data sources to synchronize device IDs and import or export data keyed off of those mappings. Audience Manager validates the device advertising IDs (DAID) imported by customers, based on their format, to ensure they match the standard format outlined by device manufacturers. |
| [ID Mapping Limits](../features/administration/usage-limits.md#id-mapping-limits) |We have improved segmentation, reporting, and exporting of segments by limiting the number of cross-device ID mappings associated to a device ID. The newly imposed limits help us mitigate the impact that incorrect integrations and inaccurate data sets may have on ingestion and downstream processing. <br/> The new limits are: <ul><li>100 device IDs per cross-device ID</li><li>10 cross-device IDs per device ID</li><li>1000 device IDs to 1 device ID</li></ul> |

## February, 2019 {#aam-february-updates}

| Topic | Description |
|--- |----|
| [Trait Recommendations](../features/segments/trait-recommendations.md) | With Trait Recommendations, when you build or edit a segment in [Segment Builder](../features/segments/segment-builder.md), you get recommendations on additional traits you can include, that are similar to the traits in the segment rule. Add the recommended traits to your segment to increase your target audience. |

## January, 2019 {#aam-january-updates}
