# Time Zones in Audience Manager

Unless otherwise specified, all the dates and date ranges you can select in the Adobe Audience Manager UI are [ Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc). For example, in the [ Create Destination](../c_features/c_destinations/create-url-destination.md#section_45FF2A8E4EB648488578365DB5D15219) flow, when mapping segments to your destination, the start and end date you select are midnight UTC. The same applies for all the dates in Audience Manager.
