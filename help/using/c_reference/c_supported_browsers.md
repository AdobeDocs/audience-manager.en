# Supported Browsers

Unless indicated otherwise, [!DNL  Audience Manager] is supported on the latest versions of the following browsers. 


* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Internet Explorer (version 11 or greater) 
  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >In January, 2016, [!DNL  Adobe] ended support for Internet Explorer 9 and 10. You can continue to use earlier browser versions, but [!DNL  Adobe] will not test against earlier versions and will not fix any issues with them. As a result, your browser experience may degrade over time and you run a security risk by using an obsolete browser version. [!DNL  Adobe] recommends that you upgrade to a supported version. 


* Safari


Other browsers may work, but are not supported by our technical and product teams. If you're having trouble working with Audience Manager, make sure you're using a current, updated, and supported browser.
