# Bulk Management Tools


>[!NOTE] {type="attention"}
>
>The [!UICONTROL  Bulk Management Tools]* are not* supported by [!DNL  Audience Manager]. This tool is provided for convenience and as a courtesy only. For bulk changes, we recommend that you work with the [ Audience Manager APIs](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/?f=c_api.html) instead. [ RBAC group permissions](../../c_features/c_administration/c_administration.md#concept_A606A162611E4256BB80F60715282296) assigned in the Audience Manager UI are honored in the Bulk Management Tools. 



## Overview {#section_A45262A175E84DE1946675A1AB0E8055}

This feature uses an Excel spreadsheet with macros that make secure, authenticated calls to the [!DNL  Audience Manager] APIs. The API provides the methods and services that let you make changes in bulk. You don't have to know how to code or work with our APIs to use it. The worksheet contains column headers and tabs that perform specific bulk change functions. To make bulk changes, all you do is add the pre-defined headers to specific worksheets, provide the information you want to change in bulk, and click an action button. The worksheet and the APIs do the rest of the work for you.
