# Derived Signals {#derived-signals}

A [!UICONTROL derived signal] qualifies site visitors for additional traits based on a trait they've already seen. In other words, additional trait qualification can be derived from a currently exhibited trait even if a user has never seen the new trait before.

<!-- c_tb_derived_signal.xml -->

## Purpose of Derived Signals

In [!DNL Audience Manager], you can create a relationship between signals (or trait rules) passed in during an event call to other, specified signals or traits. For example, assume an event call passes in a signal composed of the key-value [!DNL "product = new_car"] ( `https://<domain alias>/event?product=new_car`). [!DNL Audience Manager] would connect that signal to any others created with the [!UICONTROL derived signals] tool. Although the associated signals can be any key-values you specify, they are most useful when linked to existing signals already set up as [!UICONTROL Trait Builder] rules. For example, in the illustration below, when a user action fires the signal [!DNL "product = new car"] that user can also qualify for traits defined by the target key and value signals.
