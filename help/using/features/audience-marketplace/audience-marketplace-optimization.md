# Audience Marketplace enhancements {#audience-marketplace-enhancements}

Adobe is enhancing the Audience Marketplace to improve the visibility of data providers with active feeds.

During this process, we are removing data providers that are not actively being used. This optimization process is designed to streamline the marketplace and improve overall performance for all users.

**Timeline:** The changes will be implemented starting with June 20, 2025. Data providers will be removed on July 20, 2025.

## What's changing {#what-changes}

As part of our ongoing commitment to provide the best possible Audience Manager experience, we are removing data providers from the Audience Marketplace that have:

* Low or no usage patterns
