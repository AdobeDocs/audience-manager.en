# Audience Marketplace enhancements {#audience-marketplace-enhancements}

Adobe is enhancing the Audience Marketplace to improve the visibility of data providers with active feeds.

During this process, we are removing data providers that are not actively being used. This optimization process is designed to streamline the marketplace and improve overall performance for all users.

## What's changing {#what-changes}

As part of our ongoing commitment to provide the best possible Audience Manager experience, we are removing data providers from the Audience Marketplace that have:

* Low or no usage patterns
* Inactive data feeds
* Limited customer engagement

## Impact on your business {#impact}

This optimization may affect your current data provider relationships and available data sources. We recommend that you:

1. **Review your current data providers**: Check which providers you are actively using
2. **Assess business impact**: Determine if any of the providers being removed are critical to your business
3. **Contact Adobe if needed**: Reach out if you have concerns about specific data providers being removed

## Data providers being removed {#data-providers-list}

The data providers listed below will be marked as **[!UICONTROL suspended]** in the Audience Marketplace UI. Audiences using data from these data providers will also be marked as **[!UICONTROL suspended]** in the Audience Manager UI.

*The complete list of data providers being removed will be updated here as the optimization process continues.*
