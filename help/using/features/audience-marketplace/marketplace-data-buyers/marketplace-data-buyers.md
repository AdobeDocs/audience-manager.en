## The [!UICONTROL Marketplace]: About {#about-marketplace}

The [!UICONTROL Marketplace] is an [!DNL Audience Manager] feature for data buyers that lists data feeds you can subscribe to. It lists flat rate, [!DNL CPM], and private data feeds. These feeds are provided by third-party vendors that use [!DNL Audience Manager] to sell data.

In the [!UICONTROL Marketplace], reporting tools let you track feed usage and the overlap between your [!UICONTROL traits] and those in a subscribed data feed. Finally, with [!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace], [!DNL Adobe] takes care of invoices and fee payments (though you do have to self-report usage when subscribed to a [!DNL CPM] feed). These features let you find effective data sources without wasting time looking for a data provider.

>[!TIP]
>
>Use the **[Adobe Audience Finder](https://www.adobe-audience-finder.com/)** to find high quality data feeds that you can subscribe to. Then, go back into the [!DNL Audience Manager] user interface or use the [Audience Marketplace Buyer API](https://bank.demdex.com/portal/swagger/index.html#/Audience_Marketplace_Buyer_API) to subscribe to the feeds you found.

## Finding Similar [!UICONTROL Traits] {#finding-similar-traits}

[!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace] gives you the option to find [!UICONTROL traits] from various data feeds, based on their similarity to your existing [!UICONTROL traits] or segments. Here's how to do this:

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace]** > **[!UICONTROL Marketplace]**.
2. Use the **[!UICONTROL Similarity To]** selector to choose between filtering based on a [!UICONTROL trait] or [!UICONTROL segment]. You can filter based on [!UICONTROL trait]/[!UICONTROL segment] ID or name. The search box automatically shows you relevant suggestions based on your input.
3. Once you've identified the trait or segment that you want to filter by, click it in the suggestions list.
4. To narrow down the results, use the **[!UICONTROL Similarity Cutoff]** slider to move from less similar [!UICONTROL traits], to more similar ones.

Once the filtering is complete, you'll see a new column in the results page: **[!UICONTROL Similar Traits]**. This column shows you the number of similar [!UICONTROL traits] to the one you filtered by, from each data feed that meets the filtering criteria.

To see the full list of similar traits, click the number in the **[!UICONTROL Similar Traits]** column.

## Private Data Feeds {#private-data-feeds}

In the [!UICONTROL Marketplace] list, sometimes the provider's name and [!UICONTROL trait] data are marked as private. This indicates a [private data feed](../../../features/audience-marketplace/marketplace-private-feeds.md). A private data feed lets sellers limit buyer access to their data. Sellers can make feeds private when they're offering special deals, discounts, or when privacy and access control are important to them. As a buyer, you have to send a subscription request to the seller if you want access to a private feed. See [Subscribe to a Private Data Feed](../../../features/audience-marketplace/marketplace-data-buyers/marketplace-manage-subscriptions.md#subscript-private-data-feed) for details.
