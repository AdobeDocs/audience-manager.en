The [!UICONTROL Marketplace] is an [!DNL Audience Manager] feature for data buyers that lists data feeds you can subscribe to. It lists flat rate, CPM, or private data feeds. These feeds are provided by third-party vendors that use [!DNL Audience Manager] to sell data. In the [!UICONTROL Marketplace], reporting tools let you track feed usage and the overlap between your traits and those in a subscribed data feed. Finally, with [!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace], [!DNL Adobe] takes care of invoices and fee payments (though you do have to self-report usage when subscribed to a CPM feed). These features let you find effective data sources without wasting time looking for a data provider.

## Private Data Feeds {#section_FF7054C8EF3D4BC8A005FACBDFFB3AC1}

In the [!UICONTROL Marketplace] list, sometimes the provider's name and trait data are marked as private. This indicates a [private data feed](../../../features/audience-marketplace/marketplace-private-feeds.md#concept_68EDE94B558C4B88BBCC994B67726FD2). A private data feed lets sellers limit buyer access to their data. Sellers can make feeds private when they're offering special deals, discounts, or when privacy and access control are important to them. As a buyer, you have to send a subscription request to the seller if you want access to a private feed. See [Subscribe to a Private Data Feed](../../../features/audience-marketplace/marketplace-data-buyers/marketplace-manage-subscriptions.md#task_201526273485445EB6DB0FAD196259C5) for details.
