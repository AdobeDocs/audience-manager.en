# Create Traits from Signals

Create new traits from all signals, including those that are already used in traits, and capture future audiences that qualify after trait creation. Watch the video for a quick demonstration or read on for detailed information:

## Create Traits from Signal Dashboard {#create-traits-from-signal-dashboard}

The [!UICONTROL Signal Dashboard] allows you to create new traits from the [!UICONTROL Top Unused Signals], [!UICONTROL New Unused Signals], and your saved searches.

When you create a new trait, the trait type is pre-set based on the signal type:

* **[!UICONTROL Rule-based]** traits for real-time signals, actionable log files and [!DNL Adobe Analytics] signals;

* **[!UICONTROL Onboarded]** traits for onboarded signals.

To create new traits from the **[!UICONTROL Signal Dashboard]**, identify the signal that you want to use in the trait, then click the corresponding **[!UICONTROL Create Rule-Based Trait]** or **[!UICONTROL Create Onboarded Trait]** link.

You'll be redirected to the **[Trait Builder](../../features/traits/about-trait-builder.md)** to create your new trait(s).

## Create Traits from Signal Search {#create-traits-from-signal-search}

Create traits based on used or unused signals that are not shown in the [!UICONTROL Signal Dashboard].

Search for specific signals and create rule-based or onboarded traits based on the results. Here's how to do this:

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Audience Data > Signals > Search]** and run a search based on the key-value pairs that you are looking for, or click **[!UICONTROL Search]** without entering any key-value pair to display all results.
2. Identify the signal(s) that you want to use in the trait, in the results list.
    * To create a trait from one signal, click the corresponding **[!UICONTROL Create Rule-Based Trait]** or **[!UICONTROL Create Onboarded Trait]** link.
    * To create a trait from multiple signals, click the corresponding check box of each signal, then click **[!UICONTROL Create Trait from Multiple Signals]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >You can only create traits from signals of the same type. You cannot create a trait based on a combination of a real-time signal and an onboarded one.

   >You can create traits from used signals, too. Signals that are already used in traits have the number of traits displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Included in Traits]** column. Click the arrow to see the traits that include the signal.

3. Use the **[Trait Builder](../../features/traits/about-trait-builder.md)** to create your new traits.
