# Trait Storage {#trait-storage}

Trait storage folders store and help you organize traits.

<!-- c_tb_storage.xml -->

## Purpose of Trait Storage Folders

In [!UICONTROL Trait Builder], trait storage folders are directories that hold and organize traits into logical groups that you create. Access the storage folders from the [!UICONTROL Traits] dashboard or when creating a new trait. Remember, you cannot create a new trait without assigning it to a storage folder.
