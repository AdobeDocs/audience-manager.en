# Profile Merge Rules Dashboard {#profile-merge-rules-dashboard}

Create and manage all your merge rules from the dashboard. You can create a maximum of 3 [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules].

The [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules] dashboard provides a unified workspace that lets you manage your [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules]. The dashboard is located at **[!UICONTROL Audience Data]** > **[!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules]**. Your rules dashboard could look similar to the example shown below.

When working with [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules], you can:

* Create a maximum of 3 rules from your cross-device data sources. See [Create a Cross-Device Data Source](../../features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rules-start.md#create-data-source).
* Designate a default merge rule. [Segment Builder](../../features/segments/segment-builder.md) automatically applies the default rule to any new segments you create.
* Apply [Data Export Controls](../../features/data-export-controls.md) to a merge rule. [!UICONTROL Data Export Controls] prevent you from sending data to destinations when that would violate data privacy or use agreements.
* Track the average number of devices for each user.
* Work with basic controls to create, edit, and delete rules. Only administrators can manage rules, but other users can view them and apply them to segments. See [Profile Merge Rule Options Defined](../../features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rule-definitions.md) and [Use Cases for Merge Rules](../../features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rule-targeting-options.md).
