# Important Considerations for Profile Merge Rules with Device Graphs {#important-considerations-for-profile-merge-rules-with-device-graphs}

Avoid using [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules] with a [!UICONTROL Device Graph] for segments which have little to no real-time segment population.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If the [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] is configured incorrectly, the segment population exported to batch destinations may be significantly lower than expected.

Segments using a [Profile Merge Rule with a Device Graph](../../features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rule-targeting-options.md#device-graph-options) are only evaluated against devices seen in real-time on [Audience Manager’s Edge Servers](../../reference/system-components/components-edge.md) after the segment has been created.

Remember, a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] with a [!UICONTROL Device Graph] has one of the following device options selected, as shown below.

Devices that qualify for a segment in real-time are measured by the [segment’s real-time population](../../features/segments/segment-builder-data.md#segment-populations).

A low real-time segment population means that very few of the devices qualifying for the segment are being seen in real-time. For best performance, segments with little to no real-time population should use a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] set to evaluate the *[!UICONTROL Current Device]*, like in the image below.

Setting the [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] to evaluate the *[!UICONTROL Current Device]* ensures that all devices (not just those seen in real-time) are evaluated for the segment. All devices qualifying for the segment are defined by the total segment population, as shown below.
