## Create a Predictive Audiences Model {#create-predictive-audiences}

Before you create a [!UICONTROL Predictive Audiences] model, you need to decide which first-party data source you want to assign your [!UICONTROL Predictive Audiences] traits and segments to. You can use an existing first-party data source, or create a new one. See [Manage Data Sources](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/audience-manager/user-guide/features/data-sources/manage-datasources.html) for details on how to create a new first-party data source.

Once you know which data source you're going to use, follow the steps below.

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Audience Data]** > **[!UICONTROL Models]**.
1. In the [!UICONTROL Predictive Audiences] section, click **[!UICONTROL Add New]**.

1. Next, define the personas that you want to classify your audience by. You can do this by choosing either traits or segments to build personas from. Use the [!UICONTROL Traits] and [!UICONTROL Segments] tabs in the upper left corner of the screen to switch between your trait and segments catalog. Once you've identified the traits or segments that you want to use as personas, click the corresponding **[!UICONTROL Add]** icon in the [!UICONTROL Action] column.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Next]** after you've defined your personas.
1. Next, select the first-party audience that you want to classify by choosing a first-party trait or segment for this audience. Use the [!UICONTROL Traits] and [!UICONTROL Segments] tabs in the upper left corner of the screen to switch between your traits and segments catalog.
