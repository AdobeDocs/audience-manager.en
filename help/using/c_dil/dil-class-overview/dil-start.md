Describes authentication requirements and the text formatting used in the class-level DIL documentation.

## Getting Started With Class-level DIL APIs {#concept_B7A4B8B8F34440AF805BC426453B78FD}

Describes authentication requirements and the text formatting used in the class-level [!UICONTROL DIL] documentation.

<!-- c_class_start.xml -->

When working with the class-level [!UICONTROL DIL] APIs:

* Access requires a partner name and container namespace ID (NSID). Contact your Audience Manager account manager to obtain this information. 
* Replace any sample *italicized* text in the API documentation with value, ID, or other variable as required by the method you're working with. 
* [!UICONTROL DIL] writes encoded data to a destination cookie. For example, spaces are encoded as `%20` and semicolons as `%3B`.
