# Filter Search Results{#filter-search-results}

Filter the results of a signal search based on the signal type.

1. Run a [Signals Search](../../../c-features/data-explorer/data-explorer-signals-search/data-explorer-signals-search.md#concept_B0C0DC44C3EC4CF8926847F9062F0EC0) with the desired key-value pairs, or a broader search, using the filters.
1. Use the **[!UICONTROL Filter by Signal Type]** section to filter your results based on the following categories:

    * **Actionable log files**: signals received through [!DNL Google] [!DNL DCM] log files; 
    * **Adobe Analytics**: signals received from your [!DNL Adobe Analytics] account. Use the **[!UICONTROL Filter by report suites]** drop-down menu to select the report suite to show signals from. 
    * **General online data**: real-time data generated by your visitors and not included in actionable log files and [!DNL Adobe Analytics]; 
    * **Onboarded records**: data received through batch data transfers. Use the **[!UICONTROL Filter by data source]** drop-down menu to select the data source to show signals from.

1. Optionally, you can [Save Search Criteria](../../../c-features/data-explorer/data-explorer-signals-search/data-explorer-save-search.md#task_F78A67C962D94C1D828B2A4941EAFB6A) for future use.
