# Filter Search Results {#filter-search-results}

Filter the results of a signal search based on the signal type.

1. Go to [!UICONTROL Audience Data > Signals > Search] and run a [!UICONTROL Signals Search] with the desired key-value pairs, or a broader search, using the filters.
2. Use the **[!UICONTROL Filter by Signal Type]** section to filter your results based on the following categories:

    * **Actionable log files**: signals received through [!DNL Google] [!DNL DCM] log files;
    * **Adobe Analytics**: signals received from your [!DNL Adobe Analytics] account. Use the **[!UICONTROL Filter by report suites]** drop-down menu to select the report suite to show signals from.
    * **General online data**: real-time data generated by your visitors and not included in actionable log files and [!DNL Adobe Analytics];
    * **Onboarded records**: data received through batch data transfers. Use the **[!UICONTROL Filter by data source]** drop-down menu to select the data source to show signals from.

3. Optionally, you can [Save Search Criteria](../../../c-features/data-explorer/data-explorer-signals-search/data-explorer-save-search.md#task_F78A67C962D94C1D828B2A4941EAFB6A) for future use.
