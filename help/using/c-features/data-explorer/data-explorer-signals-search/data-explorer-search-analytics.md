This integration allows you to see the friendly names for key-value pairs derived from [!DNL Adobe Analytics] report suites. Here's how to do this:

1. Go to [!UICONTROL Signal Search] and enable the **[!UICONTROL Advanced search for Adobe Analytics]** option. 

1. Use the **[!UICONTROL Report Suite]** drop-down menu to search for and select the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] report suite to be used. 

1. Enter the rest of the search criteria and click **[!UICONTROL Search]**. To search for all the signals in the specified report suite, leave the key-value fields blank.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The **[!UICONTROL Key or Key Name]** field shows auto-completed suggestions based on your input, as well as friendly names for the keys that you enter.
