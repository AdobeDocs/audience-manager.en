# Create Traits from Signal Dashboard{#create-traits-from-signal-dashboard}

The Signal Dashboard allows you to create new traits from the Top Unused Signals , New Unused Signals, and your saved searches.

When you create a new trait, the trait type is pre-set based on the signal type:

* **Rule-based** traits for real-time signals, actionable log files and [!DNL Adobe Analytics] signals; 

* **Onboarded** traits for onboarded signals.

To create new traits from the **[!UICONTROL Signal Dashboard]**, identify the signal that you want to use in the trait, then click the corresponding **[!UICONTROL Create Rule-Based Trait]** or **[!UICONTROL Create Onboarded Trait]** link.

You'll be redirected to the ** [Trait Builder](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_trait_create.html)** to create your new trait(s).

To create traits from multiple signals, use [Signal Search](../../../c-features/data-explorer/data-explorer-create-trait/data-explorer-create-search.md#concept_D7D8B9F4A7844324952DD893DD9D851F).
