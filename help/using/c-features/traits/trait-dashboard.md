# Traits Dashboard {#traits-dashboard}

The Traits dashboard is a centralized workspace for managing traits.

<!--
c_tb_dashboard.xml

The [!UICONTROL Traits] dashboard contains features and tools that help you:

1. See all your traits and related details in a table with columns you can sort. 
1. Review and work with [Active Audience Traits and Data Source Synced Traits](../../c-features/traits/client-activity-synced-audience-traits.md#concept_7D3F4AF1FAD440509956632B8A51E64D). 
1. Create, edit, and delete traits. 
1. View and manage trait storage folders. 
1. Search for traits by name, ID, description or data source. Click on a folder while searching to limit results to that folder and its subfolders. 
1. Filter traits by trait type (onboarded, rules-based, algorithmic, folder traits).
