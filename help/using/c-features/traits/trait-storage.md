# Trait Storage {#concept_492988EC858545AAA5D1B8F06D273BDD}

Trait storage folders store and help you organize traits.

## Purpose of Trait Storage Folders

In [!UICONTROL Trait Builder], trait storage folders are directories that hold and organize traits into logical groups that you create. Access the storage folders from the [!UICONTROL Traits] dashboard or when creating a new trait. Remember, you cannot create a new trait without assigning it to a storage folder.
