How trait time-to-live (TTL) interval affects segment membership.

## Time to Live

TTL defines how long a site visitor remains in a segment after the last trait qualification event. TTL is set on traits and not on segments. Visitors fall out of a segment if they do not see a qualifying trait before the end of the TTL interval. The default TTL for new traits is 120-days. When set to 0-days, the trait never expires. [Set the TTL value](../../c-features/traits/create-onboarded-rule-based-traits.md#task_F17639E26C2744A0942461FCCD4D4DC7) when you create or edit a trait in the Advanced Options section of the trait creation interface.

## TTL and Dropping Out of a Segment

A user falls out of a segment if they do not see any of its traits within the TTL interval. For example, if you have a 1-trait segment with a 30-day TTL, the user will drop out of that segment if they do not see the trait again within the 30 days.

## TTL and Segment Renewal

The TTL resets, and the user remains in a segment, if they see that segmentâ€™s trait within the TTL period. Also, because most segments contain multiple traits with their own TTL periods, a user can remain in a segment (and reset the TTL interval) as long as they keep seeing any traits associated with a segment. For example, say you have Segment 1 composed of Trait A (30-day TTL) and Trait B (15-day TTL). Assuming the user sees each trait only once, the illustration below outlines the TTL renewal process and total in-segment duration.

## [!DNL Audience Manager] TTLs are Independent of Third-Party TTL Settings

Remember, the TTL set on your [!DNL Audience Manager] pixel operates independently from the TTL set on other pixels used by third parties (DSPs, ad networks, etc.).
