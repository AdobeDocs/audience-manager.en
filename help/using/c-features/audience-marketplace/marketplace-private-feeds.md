A private data feed is an option that lets providers limit buyer access to their data. Data providers and buyers should review this information before creating and subscribing to private data feeds.

## Private Data Feeds for Providers {#section_0CB3038BC5AC4279B99BD414C5D7AF44}

As a provider, your data feeds can be public or private. A private data feed lets you limit buyer access to your data, including the name of the data seller. You may want to create a private data feed to offer special deals, discounts, or when privacy and access control are important. With a private data feed, you get to review and approve buyer requests. After you approve a request, the feed looks just like a public data feed to the buyer. You can view and manage all your feeds in **[!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace > My Shared Data]**. As shown below, this type of feed is marked "Private" in the status column.

**Managing Feed Requests**

Clicking the name of a private data feed from [!UICONTROL My Shared Data] takes you to a page that contains several tabs. Click a tab to manage your private data feed requests.

The following table defines the role or functions provided by each action tab.

## Private Data Feeds for Buyers {#section_13E0F80D034143FAA89D72418A76AC26}

As a buyer, private data feeds appear in the [Marketplace](../../c-features/audience-marketplace/marketplace-data-buyers/marketplace-data-buyers.md#concept_47C5946409634F8F8DF885977A705B8C) like any other offer. However, in this case, the feed list does not show summary information for traits, unique users, and user overlap. Also, the data seller has an option to show or hide their name in the [!UICONTROL Provider] column of the [!UICONTROL Marketplace] list. After the seller approves your subscription request, all the data in a private feed becomes available to you (it works just like a public feed). The [!UICONTROL Marketplace] example below lists the 3 different feed types available to you as a buyer.

Feed types include:

The table describes how these different feed types show or hide data.
