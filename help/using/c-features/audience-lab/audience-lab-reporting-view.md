# Test Group Reporting{#test-group-reporting}

The test group reporting section returns information on test group conversions, allowing an easy comparison of test segment efficacy. Numerous filters and dimensions are available for data visualization.



[!UICONTROL Audience Lab] returns detailed reporting information for the test segments you created and allows you to save the reporting data as CSV files. You can select between **[!UICONTROL Aggregate Reporting]** and **[!UICONTROL Trend Reporting]**. **[!UICONTROL]**

**[!UICONTROL Aggregate Reporting]** returns the absolute numbers for your test segments. **[!UICONTROL Trend Reporting]** returns a graph of the trend *over a specific period*. Four tabs enable you to customize the reports:

<table id="table_446384AE9A36408A9C570CB7DB72C3D6"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Parameter </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Description </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p> <span class="uicontrol"> Population Conversion Rate</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Returns the percentage of devices belonging to a particular test segment, which have converted. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p> <span class="uicontrol"> Converters</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Returns the number of devices that have exhibited the conversion trait(s) selected in the test groups. <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/audience-manager/kt/using/creating-conversion-traits-feature-video-use.html" format="https" scope="external"> Watch this video</a> to learn how to create conversion traits. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p> <span class="uicontrol"> Total Conversions</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Returns the number of conversions generated by the test segments. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p> <span class="uicontrol"> Test Segment Populations</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Returns the number of devices belonging to the test segments. Toggle between <span class="uicontrol"> Total Population</span> or <span class="uicontrol"> Real-time Population</span>. The difference is explained in the <a href="../../faq/faq-reporting.md#concept_8722EA8154E1416CB334FF37E2E955C4" format="dita" scope="local"> Reporting FAQ</a> . </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

You can select a specific conversion trait for which to generate the report or you can select all traits combined. You can define a date range for which the information should be returned and export the report as a CSV file.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Reporting for a test group will populate the day after its start date. 
>* A conversion is only counted for a device after the start date of a test and after the device has been added to a test segment. If a conversion happens for that device before it is assigned a test group, the conversion will not be counted.

A returned **[!UICONTROL Aggregate Reporting]** chart could look like this:

A returned **[!UICONTROL Trend Reporting]** chart could look like the one below. Select **[!UICONTROL Normalized]** in the check box if you want to ignore the absolute numbers and simply focus on the test segments trends.
