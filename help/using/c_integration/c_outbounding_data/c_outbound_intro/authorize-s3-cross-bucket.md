# Leverage Amazon S3 Cross-Account Bucket Permissions for Your Outbound Files

If you'd rather not share your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) access key and secret key with us, contact your Audience Manager consultant or Customer Care and they will set up Cross-Account Bucket Permissions for you. You only need to whitelist our Amazon S3 account ID for the S3 bucket where you wish to receive the outbound data files, as described in the [ Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example2.html). Your Audience Manager consultant or Customer Care will provide you with our Amazon S3 account ID.
