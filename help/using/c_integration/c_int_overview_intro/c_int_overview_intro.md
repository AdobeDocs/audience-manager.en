# Data Integration Methods


## Supported Data Integration Methods: Real-Time and Server-to-Server {#section_79812B3411654D35AD5C401EA81072A4}

Choosing the right integration method depends on a combination of business requirements and the technical capabilities of your data partner. Audience Manager exchanges visitor information with other data providers by either of the following methods: 


* **Real-Time:** Transfers data immediately as a user visits your site. This method is also known as a *` synchronous`* integration.
* **Batch (Server-to-Server):** Transfers data between servers on a set schedule after a visitor has left the page. This method is also known as an *` out-of-band`* or *` asynchronous`* integration.


## Prerequisites: Create a Trait Taxonomy {#section_DE0B17CD8E7A494EA27D10C5394D6F14}

Before the integration process begins, remember to [ create traits](../../c_features/c_tb_overview/c_tb_main/c_trait_create/c_trait_create.md#concept_98DD94EF9AA24422BA17B8D0760542DF) and a [ folder structure](../../c_features/c_tb_overview/c_tb_storage/t_tb_create_storage.md#task_5DC0C9CC9BAD4698A830EB04679C116E) in the [!DNL  Audience Manager] UI. The taxonomy will contain all your traits organized in a logical hierarchy.
