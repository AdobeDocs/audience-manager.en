# Leverage Amazon S3 Cross-Account Bucket Permissions for Your Outbound Files

The Outbound Data Transfer process for customers using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) requires us to ask for your Amazon S3 access key and secret key, in order to deliver the outbound data files to your bucket.



If you'd rather not share your [!DNL Amazon S3] access key and secret key with us, contact your [!DNL Audience Manager] consultant or Customer Care and they will set up [!DNL Cross-Account Bucket Permissions] for you. You only need to whitelist our [!DNL Amazon S3] account ID for the S3 bucket where you wish to receive the outbound data files, as described in the [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example2.html). Your [!DNL Audience Manager] consultant or Customer Care will provide you with our [!DNL Amazon S3] account ID.
