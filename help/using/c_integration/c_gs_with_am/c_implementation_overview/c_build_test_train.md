# Build, Test, and Train Phase

Your data collection strategy will undergo end-to-end QA testing. Partner Solutions will track discovered bugs and coordinate problem resolutions with our systems engineers. Customer training can start in parallel with these other efforts. 

The following table describes key activities that take place during this phase: 



|  Activity  | Purpose/Description  | Participants  |
