# Implementation Overview

Our implementation techniques help create consultative partnership with new clients. This process is designed to: 

* Discover and understand your business requirements
* Produce an actionable plan to address those demands
* Develop custom solutions to help meet unique requirements or use cases
* Ensure that your proprietary data is imported and made available in the Audience Manager
Our Partner Solutions and Account Management teams will work closely with you before, during, and after the implementation process. 

Audience Manager takes a phased approach to setup and implementation.
