# Time Zones in Audience Manager{#time-zones-in-audience-manager}

Audience Manager uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) across its entire UI.

Unless otherwise specified, all the dates and date ranges you can select in the [!DNL Adobe] [!DNL Audience Manager] UI are [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc). For example, in the [Create Destination](../features/destinations/create-cookie-destination.md#segments-mapping) flow, when mapping segments to your destination, the start and end date you select are midnight UTC. The same applies for all the dates in [!DNL Audience Manager].
