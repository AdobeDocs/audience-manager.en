Unless indicated otherwise, [!DNL Audience Manager] is supported on the latest versions of the following browsers.

* Google Chrome 
* Microsoft Edge 
* Mozilla Firefox 
* Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 11 or greater)

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >In January, 2016, [!DNL Adobe] ended support for Internet Explorer 9 and 10. You can continue to use earlier browser versions, but [!DNL Adobe] will not test against earlier versions and will not fix any issues with them. As a result, your browser experience may degrade over time and you run a security risk by using an obsolete browser version. [!DNL Adobe] recommends that you upgrade to a supported version.

* Safari

Other browsers may work, but are not supported by our technical and product teams. If you're having trouble working with [!DNL Audience Manager], make sure you're using an up to date and supported browser.
