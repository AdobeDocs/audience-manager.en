# DIL Release Notes

>[!WARNING]
>
>Starting with July 2023, Adobe has discontinued the development of the [!DNL Data Integration Library (DIL)] and the DIL extension.
><br><br>Existing customers can continue using their DIL implementation, but no support will be provided after this date.
><br><br>Customers looking to implement new data collection integrations should use the [Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html?lang=en) instead.

Refer to this page for information about the latest DIL releases. DIL is available as a direct download, with release notes, on Adobe's [Github page](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/dil/releases).
