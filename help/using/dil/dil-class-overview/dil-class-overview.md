>Beginning in July 2023, Adobe has discontinued the development of the [!DNL Data Integration Library (DIL)] and the [!DNL DIL] extension.
>
>Existing customers can continue using their [!DNL DIL] implementation. However, Adobe will not be developing [!DNL DIL] beyond this point. Customers are encouraged to evaluate [Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html?lang=en) for their long term data collection strategy.
