# Getting Started With Class-level DIL APIs{#getting-started-with-class-level-dil-apis}

The class-level DIL APIs let you programmatically create and work with Audience Manager objects. The class-level APIs work with the other instance-level functions to set values or return data.

Describes authentication requirements and the text formatting used in the class-level [!UICONTROL DIL] documentation.

When working with the class-level [!UICONTROL DIL] APIs:

* Access requires a partner name and container namespace ID (NSID). Contact your Audience Manager account manager to obtain this information. 
* Replace any sample *italicized* text in the API documentation with value, ID, or other variable as required by the method you're working with. 
* [!UICONTROL DIL] writes encoded data to a destination cookie. For example, spaces are encoded as `%20` and semicolons as `%3B`.
