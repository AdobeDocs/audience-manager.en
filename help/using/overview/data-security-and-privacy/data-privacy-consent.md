# Consent Management

## Overview

As your data processor, Adobe is not able to provide legal advice on obtaining consent. Consult your legal team for guidance. We recommend that you work with a consent management solution providers such as [Evidon](https://theblog.adobe.com/evidon-builds-gdpr-universal-consent-integration-with-launch-by-adobe/) or [TrustArc](https://theblog.adobe.com/trustarc-builds-consent-integration-launch-adobe/) to receive the best recommendations.

## Experience Cloud Opt-in Service

The [Experience Cloud Opt-in Service](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/id-service/using/implementation-guides/opt-in-service/optin-overview.html) service lets you set up protocols for the visitor to determine if you can set a cookie on the user's device or browser when visiting your site.

This is an extension of the Experience Cloud ID (ECID), designed to let you control whether and which Experience Cloud solutions can place cookies on web pages for visitors prior to user consent.

The [Experience Cloud Opt-in Service](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/id-service/using/implementation-guides/opt-in-service/optin-overview.html) also lets you set protocols to integrate with your Consent Management Platform (CMP) and existing systems as part of your larger design.

## Managing Opt-In / Obtaining Consent

In instances where consent is needed for certain marketing activities, consumer consent needs to be active (e.g., no pre-checked boxes or silence as assent), unbundled, and offers of services may not be made conditional upon the Data Subject giving consent. There may even be instances where certain consents need to be refreshed to be able to continue using data going forward.

Audience Manager customers could store user consent for various use cases such as advertising or personalization as traits in Audience Manager. Building segments with these traits will then include only users providing the respective consent for each of these use cases. Please note that using this approach does not stop data collection but will only impact data usage when you send segments for activation. When users withdraw their consent, you can remove these traits from user profile using the Audience Manager [inbound batch process](../../integration/sending-audience-data/batch-data-transfer-explained/inbound-file-contents.md) or Audience Manager opt-out process as detailed below.

## Managing Opt-Out / Withdrawal of Consent

Opt out can be managed for the Adobe Experience Cloud via the [Your Privacy Choices](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#customeruse) page. 1-click features let your end users control and opt out of data collection by the Adobe Experience Cloud advertising solutions (including Audience Manager). Specifically, see the [business customer section](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#customeruse) of the Privacy Choices page. For Browsers that do not support third-party cookies, see [Declared ID targeting](../../features/declared-ids.md#declared-id-targeting). For mobile devices, please retrieve the relevant Audience Manager identifiers and call the Audience Manager opt-out APIs as mentioned in the [Declared ID Opt-Out examples](../../features/declared-ids.md#opt-out-examples). Following that, you can cease all data collection for those users with the opt out APIs from Mobile SDK - see [Android devices](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/android/privacy.html) and [iOS devices](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/ios/privacy.html). You can find additional details for opt-out in the [Data Privacy Requests Documentation](../../overview/data-security-and-privacy/data-privacy-requests.md).

## Managing Consent for Second Party Data Providers

Second Party Data Providers are generally also Data Controllers and own the process for obtaining any needed consent from the Data Subject to share data with their second party data partners. It is the responsibility of the Audience Manager Customer to determine if the Second Party Data Provider has obtained the necessary consent for your use case. More details on obtaining consent is covered above.

## Managing Consent for Third Party Data Providers

Data Providers are also Data Controllers and own their process for obtaining consent and managing access/delete/correction requests. Adobe is proactively requesting that Data Providers update their company profile information within [Adobe Audience Finder](https://www.adobe-audience-finder.com/) with additional information on user data collection. Information will be sourced from the Data Providers and the goal is to have the tool updated by Q2 2018. However, it is up to each Audience Manager Customer to determine that the Third Party Data Provider has obtained the necessary consent for that customerâ€™s use case. Adobe makes no representations about the scope or validity of the consent obtained or reported by a Third Party Data Provider for a given use case.
