# Data Privacy Overview {#data-privacy}

## Overview

The Data Privacy documentation describes Audience Manager integration and compliance with generally accepted best practices related to consumer privacy and opt-out procedures.

Adobe recognizes the implicit pact between consumers and the online brands with which they interact. Both parties benefit from the transparent exchange of anonymous data elements:

* Consumers receive personalized content, discounted product offers, and streamlined user experiences.
* Brands receive vital revenue streams supporting multiple online business models.

In our continuing support of this model, Audience Manager remains committed to providing transparency and control to consumers, and meeting or exceeding the Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) Self-Regulatory Principles.

The [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eugdpr.org/) introduced several new data privacy rights for members of the European Union, including the **Right to Access** and the **Right to be Forgotten**. This means that any EU citizen whose personal data has been collected by your business can request to access or delete their data at any time. Failure to comply to these requests within 30 days can result in multi-million dollar fines for your organization.

To comply with GDPR, Audience Manager supports data access and delete [requests](data-privacy-requests.md).

The [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://www.caprivacy.org/about) enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, United States, and is set to become effective on January 1, 2020.

The CCPA provides new data privacy rights to California residents, including the right to access and delete their personal data and to know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed (and to whom). In anticipation of the CCPA, Audience Manager supports CCPA access and delete [requests](data-privacy-requests.md).

See the [Adobe Privacy Center](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html) for more details.

## Regulations Compliance {#compliance}

Adobe ensures the Audience Manager privacy regulations compliance through the [Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/services/privacy-service.html) for data access and delete requests.

This service provides a [!DNL RESTful API] and user interface to help you manage customer data requests. Using the [Privacy Service](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/services/privacy-service.html), you can submit requests to access and delete private or personal customer data, facilitating automated compliance with organizational and legal privacy regulations.

While data access and deletion requests are handled through the [Privacy Service](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/services/privacy-service.html), [opt-out requests](data-privacy-requests.md#opt-out-requests) are currently supported through the [DCS API](../../api/dcs-intro/dcs-api-reference/dcs-api-reference-overview.md). See [Data Privacy Requests](data-privacy-requests.md) for details.
