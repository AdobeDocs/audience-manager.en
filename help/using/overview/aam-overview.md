**Data In**

Audience Manager collects first-party data from channels and devices (web analytics, CRM, device data, e-commerce, etc.).

**Audience Creation** 

Unifies data into audience profiles, giving you a complete customer view across devices and channels. Create look-alike models, build audience segments and groups of profiles, and supplement with second- and third-party data sources.

**Data Out** 

Activates audience segments by pushing them out to demand-side platforms (DSPs), campaign management systems and other marketing platforms.
