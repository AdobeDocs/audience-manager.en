# Implementing Audience Manager{#implementing-audience-manager}

This section outlines and explains the processes related to getting started with the Audience Manager data management platform (DMP). This section is designed to help business teams, project managers, and technology managers understand the Audience Manager implementation process. Getting started with Audience Manager can take approximately six weeks to three months, depending on your data collection needs.

## Implementing Audience Manager {#topic_A069C84E922F4ED6A30BBA2012A57A4C}

This section outlines and explains the processes related to getting started with the Audience Manager data management platform (DMP). This section is designed to help business teams, project managers, and technology managers understand the Audience Manager implementation process. Getting started with Audience Manager can take approximately six weeks to three months, depending on your data collection needs. 

Our implementation techniques help create consultative partnership with new clients. This process is designed to:

* Discover and understand your business requirements 
* Produce an actionable plan to address those demands 
* Develop custom solutions to help meet unique requirements or use cases 
* Ensure that your proprietary data is imported and made available in the Audience Manager

Our Partner Solutions and Account Management teams will work closely with you before, during, and after the implementation process.

Audience Manager takes a phased approach to setup and implementation. 

## Define Phase {#concept_115C7442BFB14A2386E3E2EABA63B885}

The define phase introduces you to our Partner Solutions project leads and begins the project management process.

<!--

This step is designed to help potential clients define and agree on project scope, understand custom requirements, establish milestones, and set up communications.

The following table describes key activities that take place during this phase:

## Code Implementation {#concept_D54ABC567FB14135AA82CCA6FEDF8AA2}

Though the deployment process may seem complex, the code implementation is as simple as adding a few lines of JavaScript adjacent to the closing `</body>` tag of your website.

<!-- 

c_code.xml

 -->

**Deployment**

The Audience Manager code snippet calls Akamai to download the business rules set up previously in the user interface. Furthermore, client browsers cache this information, which helps reduce page and server load times. Our code and data collection methodology is designed to maintain the user experience across your inventory.

**Participants**

Partner Solutions can work directly with your technical teams to help deploy code, address final concerns, and fulfill other requirements. 

## Post-Implementation Support {#concept_600952DE5E2C47A290C118F55FEDC897}

Our collaborative efforts don'â€™t stop with final deployment. After implementation is complete, our Account Management team takes over.

<!-- 

c_post_implement_support.xml

 -->

Account managers provide continuing support and consultation services after the product implementation process is complete. You can expect to have regular meetings with your account manager. These meetings ensure that you get the maximum amount of use and value from Audience Manager.
