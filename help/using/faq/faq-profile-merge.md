## Device Graph Basics {#device-graph-basics}

**What is a device graph?**

A device graph is a set of ID mappings that defines groups of anonymous devices. It associates these devices to a person or household based on common elements in the signals collected from each device. These signals help identify devices at the individual or household level.

<br>&nbsp;

**What is an external device graph?**

An external device graph is any device graph in [!DNL Audience Manager] that has not been created exclusively from your own cross-device data sources. For example, when you create a [Profile Merge Rule](../features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rules-start.md#concept_34A9CEA00B24447EBF7EA8DA2928E1DD) and choose the [!UICONTROL Co-op Device Graph] or third-party device graph options, you're working with an external device graph. See [Device Options](../features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rule-definitions.md#device-options).

<br>&nbsp;

**What are some common use cases for using an external device graph in a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule]?**

The main objective of using a device graph in a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] is to evaluate and qualify multiple devices belonging to a single person or household for a specific segment. The segment itself may have multiple uses for example, targeting an audience of prospects with and ad served by a DSP or personalizing a customerâ€™s on-site experience via an on-site personalization platform. See [External Device Graph Use Cases](../features/profile-merge-rules/external-graph-use-cases.md#concept_7C0BDBFB3392415286B624F45E8883E5).

<br>&nbsp;

**Does Audience Manager provide global support for external device graphs?**

No. External device graphs are available in the United States and Canada only.

<br>&nbsp;

**How often does [!DNL Audience Manager] update external device graph data?**

Once a week.

<br>&nbsp;

## Device Graphs and Profile Merge Rules {#device-graph-profile-merge-rules}

**How does [!DNL Audience Manager] use a device graph?**

In [!DNL Audience Manager], device graphs appear as configuration options when you [create a Profile Merge Rule](../features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rules-start.md#concept_34A9CEA00B24447EBF7EA8DA2928E1DD). Through your [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules], these device graphs help [!DNL Audience Manager]:

* Merge multiple device profiles together. This creates a single superset of traits.
* Evaluate the trait superset for segment qualification (rather than evaluating each device profile individually).
* Add qualified devices to available segments.

<br>&nbsp;

**How many [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules] can I create?**

Currently, you can create a maximum of 3 [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules].

<br>&nbsp;

**How many device profiles does [!DNL Audience Manager] merge and read when using a device graph in a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule]?**

When qualifying a device for a segment using a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule], Audience Manager merges and reads the current device profile and a maximum of 3 additional device profiles linked by your selected device graph option.

<br>&nbsp;

**Which devices qualify for a segment when using a device graph in a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule]?**

The devices [!DNL Audience Manager] merges and reads are the same devices that are qualified for a segment.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For external device graphs, [!DNL Audience Manager] stores the mapping between devices at the platform level and selects 3 without evaluating their relationship to the devices seen in your instance of [!DNL Audience Manager].

<br>&nbsp;

**Which devices *can* qualify for a segment using a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] that contains a device graph?**

To qualify for a segment, devices must have been seen by Audience Manager on our [edge data servers](../reference/system-components/components-edge.md#concept_DD36E2B5A23D4CC5A91CA9808B908B8E) after the segment was created. Additionally, the edge servers:

* Store profile data for a maximum of 14-days. 
* Delete a device profile if it has been inactive for more than 14-days. Note: This action only removes data from the edge. Other systems will retain records for longer time intervals. See the [Privacy and Data Retention FAQ](../faq/faq-privacy.md#concept_19A401AFC8414994810290011AA10595). 
* Reset the 14-day interval if [!DNL Audience Manager] records any activity for that profile across the entire platform.

See also, [Data Collection Components](../reference/system-components/components-data-collection.md#concept_66CFFEBF5E8B41ED94082D562A93506E).

<br>&nbsp;

**Where can [!DNL Audience Manager] send segments that have been qualified by a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] that uses a device graph?**

[!DNL Audience Manager] can send segments to a destination in batch files or in real-time. And, as noted in the FAQ entry above, To qualify for a segment, devices must have been seen by [!DNL Audience Manager] on our [edge data servers](../reference/system-components/components-edge.md#concept_DD36E2B5A23D4CC5A91CA9808B908B8E) after the segment was created.

<br>&nbsp;

## Segments, Device Graphs, and Profile Merge Rules {#segments-device-graphs-rules}

**How does [!DNL Audience Manager] un-segment a device when it is no longer qualified for a segment with a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] that uses a device graph?**

Audience Manager merges up to four devices when evaluating segments with a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] that uses a device graph. If the unsegment signal is issued, the current device and three additional devices seen in real-time will be removed from the segment in the destination. For example, in a six-device cluster, up to four devices are merged, evaluated, and qualified for a segment. Similarly, up to four devices are merged, evaluated and unsegmented.

<br>&nbsp;

**If a destination can un-segment devices, will devices be removed from segments by [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules] that use a device graph?**

Yes. See the explanation above.

<br>&nbsp;

**If I build a segment with a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] that uses a device graph and the segment is using both real-time and on-boarded data, will my segment be updated as the on-boarded data changes?**

No. Currently, [!DNL Audience Manager] evaluates segments with a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] that uses a device graph in real-time only. Updates made to on-boarded traits after the segment has been evaluated will be used to qualify the segment when the device is next seen by our [edge data servers](../reference/system-components/components-edge.md#concept_DD36E2B5A23D4CC5A91CA9808B908B8E). This assumes the device profile is still active in the edge servers and the on-boarded data has been made available to those systems. See also, the [Privacy and Data Retention FAQ](../faq/faq-privacy.md#concept_19A401AFC8414994810290011AA10595).

<br>&nbsp;

**Do segment size estimates include devices that qualify for a segment based on connections provided by a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] that uses a device graph option?**

No. See the definitions for the [!UICONTROL Estimated Real-Time Population] and [!UICONTROL Estimated Total Population] in [Trait and Segment Population Data in Segment Builder](../features/segments/segment-builder-data.md#concept_05EE3010E67F446E8818351292EF7372).

<br>&nbsp;

**Does [!UICONTROL Addressable Audiences] include devices that qualify for a segment based on connections provided by a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] that uses a device graph option?**

Yes.

<br>&nbsp;

**If a segment uses a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] with [!UICONTROL No Authenticated Profile] and the traits which qualify devices for the segment are only stored against the authenticated profile, will the total population of the segment be 0?**

No. Today, Audience Manager counts the devices which are mapped to the authenticated profile as qualifying for the segment.

<br>&nbsp;

## Trait Frequency, Device Graphs, and Profile Merge Rules {#trait-freq-device-rules}

**How does [!DNL Audience Manager] calculate trait frequency with a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] that uses a device graph?**

The trait frequency is defined by the sum of the number of qualifications for a specific trait across multiple devices. To help you understand this, take a look at the following use case.

## Reports, Device Graphs, and Profile Merge Rules {#reports-device-graphs-rules}

**Can I see the number of devices that can be reached by a [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] that uses a device graph?**

Yes. Reports return data at the [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] level. Report data is updated daily. Data is based on the devices seen in your account, not those linked by a device graph. See [Report Metrics for Profile Merge Rules](../features/profile-merge-rules/profile-link-metrics.md#concept_FBA9E3FB4E3C46EE83DB9BD4D288A0CE).

<br>&nbsp;

**Can I see the number of devices qualified for a specific segment in *real-time* with [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules] that use a device graph?**

Yes. The real-time population metric captures segment qualifications for the current device (the device seen in real-time) using the profiles from all of the devices linked by a device graph.
