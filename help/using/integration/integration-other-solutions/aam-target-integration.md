# Integrate Audience Manager With [!DNL Target] {#integrate-audience-manager-with-target}

This integration lets you send Audience Manager segments to Adobe [!DNL Target].

An Audience Manager - [!DNL Target] integration requires:

* The [Experience Cloud service](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/id-service/using/home.html). If you're not using this service, see the [implementation guides](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/id-service/using/implementation/implementation-guides.html) to get started.
* [!DNL Profiles and Audiences]. If you're not provisioned for [!DNL Profiles and Audiences], complete the form on the [Experience Cloud Integrations page](https://adobe.allegiancetech.com/cgi-bin/qwebcorporate.dll?idx=X8SVES) or contact your consultant to get started.

All of your Audience Manager segments will appear in [!DNL Target] shortly after you complete these steps in the implementation process. Look in **[!UICONTROL Audiences > Audience List]** to see your Audience Manager segments in [!DNL Target]. Identify Audience Manager segments by Experience Cloud in the **[!UICONTROL Source]** column and by `aam-integration-user@adobe.com` in the **[!UICONTROL Modified]** column.
