# Integrate Audience Manager With Target {#integrate-audience-manager-with-target}

This integration lets you send Audience Manager segments to Adobe [!DNL Target].

An Audience Manager - [!DNL Target] integration requires:

* The [Experience Cloud service](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/). If you're not using this service, see the [implementation guides](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid-implementation-guides.html) to get started.
* Profiles and Audiences. If you're not provisioned for Profiles and Audiences, complete the form on the [Experience Cloud Integrations page](https://adobe.allegiancetech.com/cgi-bin/qwebcorporate.dll?idx=X8SVES) or contact your consultant to get started.

All of your Audience Manager segments will appear in [!DNL Target] shortly after you complete these steps in the implementation process. Look in **[!UICONTROL Audiences > Audience List]** to see your Audience Manager segments in [!DNL Target]. Identify Audience Manager segments by Experience Cloud in the **[!UICONTROL Source]** column and by `aam-integration-user@adobe.com` in the **[!UICONTROL Modified]** column.
