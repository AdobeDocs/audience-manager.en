# Experience Platform segment sharing with Audience Manager and other Experience Cloud solutions

## Overview {#overview}

The audience sharing functionality between Audience Manager and Adobe Experience Platform allows you to share your Audience Manager traits and segments to Adobe Experience Platform and Experience Platform segments to Audience Manager. 

You need the [[!DNL Audience Manager source connector]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/audience-manager.html) and the [Experience Cloud Audiences](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/adobe/experience-cloud-audiences.html) destination in Experience Platform to enable audience sharing between Audience Manager and Adobe Experience Platform.

You can use Audience Manager traits and segments in Experience Platform to add Audience Manager data to your customer profiles and to benefit from the Experience Platform [segmentation service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/home.html?lang=en). 

In Audience Manager, you can use Experience Platform segments for Data Management Platform use cases, such as:
* Add [third party data](/help/using/overview/data-types-collected.md#third-party-data) to your segments;
* [Algorithmic modeling](/help/using/features/algorithmic-models/understanding-models.md);
* Activate your segments to destinations that are not yet supported in the Experience Platform [destinations catalog](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/rtcdp/destinations/destinations-cat/destinations-catalog.html).

Additionally, your Experience Platform segments are shared to other Experience Cloud solutions, via [Core Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/experience-cloud.html).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> * You need an Audience Manager license to enable the Data Management Platform use cases mentioned above.
> * You *do not need* an Audience Manager license to share Experience Platform segments with Adobe Advertising Cloud, Adobe Target, Marketo, and other Experience Cloud solutions, via the Core Services integration.

See the table below for an overview of audience sharing use cases:

|**Use Case** | **Adobe Experience Platform** | **Audience Manager** | **Core Services** |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Audience Sharing** | <ul><li>Enrich customer profiles with Audience Manager data</li><li>Use Audience Manager data in Experience Platform segmentation</li></ul> | <ul><li>Add third party data to segments</li><li>Algorithmic modeling</li><li>Activation to additional destinations</li></ul> | Use Experience Platform segments in other Experience Cloud solutions, such as Adobe Target, Advertising Cloud, or Marketo. |

## Audience Manager segments and traits in Adobe Experience Platform {#aam-segments-traits-in-aep}

The sections below describe how to enable data sharing from Audience Manager to Experience Platform and how to use Audience Manager traits and segments in Experience Platform.

### Enable data sharing from Audience Manager to Experience Platform {#enable-aam-to-aep-data}

To send segments and traits from Audience Manager to Experience Platform, you must set up the Audience Manager source connector in the Experience Platform sources catalog. This is a self-service workflow that does not require involvement from Adobe Customer Care or engineering teams. To set up the Audience Manager source connector, read:

* [Audience Manager source](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/audience-manager.html)
* [Create an Adobe Audience Manager source connection in the UI](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/ui-tutorials/create/adobe-applications/audience-manager.html?lang=en)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe encourages customers to configure the connection without selecting the **[!UICONTROL Select all segments]** and **[!UICONTROL Select all traits]** options, as shown below. The ingestion of sizeable Audience Manager segment populations has a direct impact on your total profile count when you first send an Audience Manager segment to Platform using the Audience Manager source. This means that selecting all segments can potentially lead to a Profile count in excess of your license usage entitlement. 
>
>![Screenshot showing the Select all segments and Select all traits options unchecked in the workflow to connect to the Audience Manager source connector.](/help/using/integration/integration-aep/assets/select-all-segments-traits-unchecked.png)

### Use Audience Manager traits and segments in Experience Platform {#use-aam-data-in-aep}

After setting up the Audience Manager source connector to import traits and segments from Audience Manager, your Audience Manager data appears in Experience Platform as **Audiences** in the segment workflow. For more information on your Audience Manager segments and traits in Experience Platform, read:

* [Segmentation Service overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/home.html#audiences)
* [Experience Platform Segment Builder user guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/ui/overview.html#audiences)

## Adobe Experience Platform segments in Audience Manager {#aep-segments-in-aam}

The sections below describe how to enable data sharing from Experience Platform to Audience Manager and how to use Experience Platform segments in Audience Manager.

### Enable data sharing from Experience Platform to Audience Manager {#enable-aep-to-aam-data}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> This section describes the legacy segment sharing integration from Experience Platform to Audience Manager. You can now set up this integration without support from Adobe Customer representatives. For more information, read the [Experience Cloud Audiences](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/adobe/experience-cloud-audiences.html) destination documentation.

>[!NOTE]
>
> Contact your Adobe Customer Success Manager or Customer Care to unlock access to this functionality.

To send segments from Experience Platform to Audience Manager, you must contact either Customer Care or your Customer Success Manager. Customer Care and Customer Support Management teams must file a ticket (see template ticket AAM-52354) to enable the connection from Platform to Audience Manager. 

Be sure to share plans for the data going from Platform to Audience Manager, to ensure that the connection is set up correctly. For example, if you need regional data to be shared for segments sent to Adobe Target, this information needs to be communicated in the ticket. The data sharing connection from Experience Platform to Audience Manager is set up within six business days of the request being submitted.

### Use Experience Platform segments in Audience Manager {#use-aep-data-in-aam}

Segments that you create in Experience Platform appear in your Audience Manager interface as signals, traits, and segments, with the following composition rules:

* Signal: For each Experience Platform segment, you should see signals in the form `segID = segment ID`.
* Trait: The trait rule is the ID of the Experience Platform segment.
* Segment: The segment consists of the trait described above.

### Signals {#aep-segments-as-aam-signals}

Select **[!UICONTROL Audience Data > Signals > General Online Data]** and search by `SegId` to find signals coming in from Experience Platform. You can use this screen for debugging purposes, to check if the integration between Experience Platform and Audience Manager has been set up correctly.

![See Experience Platform signals in Audience Manager in the Signals dashboard](/help/using/integration/integration-aep/assets/aep-signals-in-aam.png)

### Traits {#aep-segments-as-aam-traits}

Audience Manager automatically creates a trait folder called **Experience Platform Traits** in your trait storage.  

![Traits from Experience Platform dashboard](/help/using/integration/integration-aep/assets/aep-traits-dashboard.png)

You can use automatically created traits in segments alongside other traits. For example, you can mix traits created from Experience Platform segments with third party traits acquired through the [Audience Marketplace](/help/using/features/audience-marketplace/audience-marketplace.md).

For an example of a trait created automatically from an Experience Platform segment, see the screenshot below: 

![Trait from Experience Platform](/help/using/integration/integration-aep/assets/aep-trait.png)


|Item number | Name | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|
| 1 | [!UICONTROL Trait Type] | Traits created from Experience Platform segments are created as onboarded traits in Audience Manager.|
| 2 | [!UICONTROL Data Source] | Automatically created. All traits and segments that are created automatically from Experience Platform segments are stored in the data source **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Audience Sharing]**.|
| 3 | [!UICONTROL Integration Code] | The integration code corresponds to the segment ID in Experience Platform.|
| 4 | [!UICONTROL Trait Expression] | The trait expression is `segID = segment ID in Experience Platform`.|
| 5 | [!UICONTROL Segments with this Trait] | An automatically created segment that uses this trait as its composition.|

{style="table-layout:auto"}

### Segments {#aep-segments-as-aam-segments}

Audience Manager automatically creates a segment folder called **Experience Platform Segments** in your segment storage.

![Screenshot of dashboard](/help/using/integration/integration-aep/assets/aep-segments-dashboard.png)

For an example of a segment created automatically from an Experience Platform segment, see the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of segment](/help/using/integration/integration-aep/assets/aep-segment.png)

|Item number | Name | Description |
|---------|----------|---------|
| 1 | [!UICONTROL Integration Code] | The integration code corresponds to the segment ID in Experience Platform.|
| 2 | [!UICONTROL Data Source] | Automatically created. All traits and segments that are created automatically from Experience Platform segments are stored in the data source **[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Audience Sharing]**.|
| 3 | [!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rule] | **[!UICONTROL External Merge Policy]** indicates that automatically created segments follow the merge policy set up in Experience Platform.|
| 4 | [!UICONTROL Segment Rule] | The segment consists of the trait described in the [Traits section](#aep-segments-as-aam-traits).|

## Audience Manager Data Export Control support in Experience Platform {#aam-data-export-control-in-aep}

In order to enforce data usage compliance in Experience Platform, all applicable datasets and fields must be given appropriate [data usage labels](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-governance/labels/overview.html). In addition, [data usage policies](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-governance/policies/overview.html) must be enabled for specific marketing actions against those labels, as outlined by the [Data Usage Labeling and Enforcement (DULE) framework](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-governance/home.html#dule-framework).

In the audience sharing process between Audience Manager and Experience Platform, any Data Export Controls that have been applied to Audience Manager segments are translated to equivalent labels and marketing actions recognized by Experience Platform Data Governance, and vice versa.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For more general information on Data Export Controls, please refer to the [Data Export Controls documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/data-export-controls.html).
>
>This document provides a reference for how specific Audience Manager Data Export Controls map to data usage labels and marketing actions in Platform.

### Data Export Controls to data usage labels

The following table outlines how specific Data Export Controls map to recognized data usage labels:

| Data Export Control | Data usage label |
| --- | --- |
| Cannot be used with personally identifiable information | C3: Data cannot be combined or otherwise used with directly identifiable information |
| Cannot be used for offsite ad targeting | C5: Data cannot be used for interest-based, cross-site targeting of content or ads |
| Cannot be used for onsite ad targeting | C6: Data cannot be used for on-site ad targeting |
| Cannot be used for onsite personalization | C7: Data cannot be used for on-site targeting of content |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

### Data Export Controls to marketing actions

The following table outlines how specific Data Export Labels map to recognized marketing actions:

| Data Export Label | Marketing action |
| --- | --- |
| This destination may enable a combination with personally identifiable information (PII) | Combine with PII |
| This destination may be used for off-site ad targeting | Cross Site Targeting |
| This destination may be used for on-site ad targeting | Onsite Advertising |
| This destination may be used for on-site ad personalization | Onsite Personalization |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

## Understand segment population differences between Audience Manager and Experience Platform {#aep-aam-segment-population-differences}

Segment population numbers can vary between your Audience Manager and Experience Platform segments. While segment numbers for similar or identical audiences should be close, differences in populations can be due to factors listed below.

### Segment evaluation in Experience Platform

Audience Manager updates reporting numbers in the interface once per day. The timing of this update rarely aligns with the time of the segment evaluation in Experience Platform.

### Differences between Profile Merge Rules and Merge Policies

[[!UICONTROL Profile Merge Rules]](/help/using/features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rules-overview.md) in Audience Manager and [[!UICONTROL Merge Policies]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/ui/merge-policies.html) in Experience Platform work differently, and the identity graph used for each varies. Because of this, some differences between segment populations are expected.

>[!NOTE]
>
> When sharing segments from Experience Platform to Audience Manager, your Platform organization [default merge policy](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/merge-policies/overview.html?lang=en#default-merge-policy) takes precedence over the [merge policy used by the segment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/ui/segment-builder.html?lang=en#merge-policies) shared with Audience Manager. For example, if the shared segment's merge policy allows for [ID stitching](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/merge-policies/ui-guide.html?lang=en#configure), but the organization's default merge policy does not, this might result in population differences between Platform and Audience Manager.

### Segment composition in Experience Platform

The integration between Adobe Experience Platform and Audience Manager shares a number of standard [identity namespaces](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/identity/namespaces.html#identity-types) for all customers: ECID, IDFA, GAID, hashed email addresses (EMAIL_LC_SHA256), AdCloud ID. If your Experience Platform segments use any of these as primary identity for the qualified profiles, the profiles are counted in Audience Manager traits and segments.

>[!NOTE]
>
> Audiences in Experience Platform with identities keyed off raw emails never appear in Audience Manager.

For example, if you had an Experience Platform segment "All my customers", and the qualified profiles would be CRM IDs, ECID, IDFA, raw and hashed email addresses, the corresponding segment in Audience Manager would only include profiles keyed off of ECID, IDFA, and hashed email addresses. The segment population in Audience Manager would be smaller than the one in Experience Platform.

![Experience Platform to Audience Manager segment sharing - segment composition](assets/AEP-to-AAM-profiles.png)

<!--

If you created a data source in Audience Manager for the CRM IDs in Experience Platform, then the qualified profiles keyed off those CRM IDs would appear in Audience Manager and the segment population in Audience Manager would increase.
