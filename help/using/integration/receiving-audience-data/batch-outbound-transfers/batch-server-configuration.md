# Configure Batch Data Transfer Integration

Before you can send batch data to third-party content providers, you need to configure the integration between Audience Manager and the third-party content provider. You can do this in two ways:

## Request assistance configuration via your Adobe consultant {#config-consultant}

If you are working with an Adobe consultant, they will take care of the configuration process for you.

## Request assistance configuration via Adobe Customer Support {#config-support}

If you are not working with an Adobe consultant, you can still get batch transfer integration configured by Customer Support. Contact Customer Support for details.

> Make sure to generate the keys in OpenSSH format.
