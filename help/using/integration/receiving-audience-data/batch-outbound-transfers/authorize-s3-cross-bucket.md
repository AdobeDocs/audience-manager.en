# Leverage Amazon S3 Cross-Account Bucket Permissions for Your Outbound Files {#leverage-amazon-s-cross-account-bucket-permissions-for-your-outbound-files}

The Outbound Data Transfer process for customers using [!DNL Amazon Simple Storage Service] ([!DNL Amazon S3]) requires us to ask for your [!DNL Amazon S3] access key and secret key, in order to deliver the outbound data files to your bucket.

If you'd rather not share your [!DNL Amazon S3] access key and secret key with us, contact your [!DNL Audience Manager] consultant or Customer Care and they will set up [!DNL Cross-Account Bucket Permissions] for you. You only need to whitelist our [!DNL Amazon S3] account ID for the [!DNL S3] bucket where you wish to receive the outbound data files, as described in the [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example2.html). Your [!DNL Audience Manager] consultant or Customer Care will provide you with our [!DNL Amazon S3] account ID.
