# [!DNL OAuth 2.0] Integration for Real-Time Outbound Transfers{#oauth-integration-for-real-time-outbound-transfers}

When publishing segments to the partner destination via a realtime server-to-server integration, Audience Manager can be set up to authenticate using [!DNL OAuth 2.0] when making the requests. This presents the ability to issue authenticated requests from Audience Manager to your endpoint.

## Authentication Flow {#auth-flow}

The [!DNL Adobe Audience Manager] [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) authentication implementation is based on the Client Credentials grant flow and follows these steps:

1. You must provide us with:
    * The [!DNL OAuth 2.0] endpoint that generates the authentication token.
    * The credentials used to generate a token.
1. An [!DNL Audience Manager] consultant sets up the [destination](../../../features/destinations/destinations.md) using the information you provided.
1. Once a segment is mapped to this destination, our real-time data transfer system, [IRIS](../../../reference/system-components/components-data-action.md#iris), makes a `POST` request to the token endpoint to exchange the credentials for a bearer token.
1. For each segment publishing request to the partner endpoint, [!UICONTROL IRIS] uses the bearer token to authenticate.

## Requirements {#auth-requirements}

As an [!DNL Audience Manager] partner, the following endpoints are needed to receive authenticated requests:

### Endpoint 1 used by IRIS to obtain a bearer token

This endpoint will accept the credentials provided at step 1 and generate a bearer token which will be used on subsequent requests.

* The endpoint must accept `HTTP POST` requests.
* The endpoint must accept and look at the [!DNL Authorization] header. The value for this header will be: `Basic <credentials_provided_by_partner>`.
* The endpoint must look at the [!DNL Content-type] header and validate that its value is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded ; charset=UTF-8`.
* The body of the request will be `grant_type=client_credentials`.

### Example request made by Audience Manager to the partner endpoint in order to obtain a bearer token

```
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: api.partner.com
User-Agent: Adobe Audience Manager Iris
Authorization: Basic zq2LOO1CcYGrODS5nXiNHpEz97eCpVHAoMF8pAgCntXAzxp5uRV7DTAE2qtPLjhMQwrEX3O6MHV4S
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 29
Accept-Encoding: gzip
  
grant_type=client_credentials
```

### Example response from the partner endpoint

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Status: 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
...
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 121
  
{"token_type":"Bearer","access_token":"glIbBVohK8d86alDEnllPWi6IpjZvJC6kwBRuuawts6YMkw4tZkt84rEZYU2ZKHCQP3TT7PnzCQPI0yY"}
```

### Endpoint 2 used by IRIS to publish segments using the bearer token

[!DNL Audience Manager] sends data to this endpoint in near real-time as users qualify for segments. Additionally, this method can send batches of offline or onboarded data as frequently as every 24 hours.

The bearer token generated by endpoint 1 is used to issue requests to this endpoint. The [!DNL Audience Manager] real-time data transfer system, [IRIS](../../../reference/system-components/components-data-action.md#iris), constructs a normal HTTPS request and includes an Authorization header. The value for this header will be: Bearer `<bearer token from step 1>`.

### Example response from the partner endpoint

```
GET /segments/aam HTTP/1.1
Host: api.partner.com
User-Agent: Adobe Audience Manager Iris
Authorization: Bearer glIbBVohK8d86alDEnllPWi6IpjZvJC6kwBRuuawts6YMkw4tZkt84rEZYU2ZKHCQP3TT7PnzCQPI0yY
Content-Type: application/json
Accept-Encoding: gzip

      ]
   }]
}
```

## Important Considerations {#considerations}

### Tokens are passwords

The credentials presented by the partner and the tokens obtained by [!DNL Audience Manager] when authenticating using the [!DNL OAuth 2.0] flow, are sensitive information and must not be shared with third parties.

### [!DNL SSL] is required

[!DNL SSL] must be used in order to maintain a secure authentication process. All requests, including the ones used to obtain and use the tokens must use `HTTPS` endpoints.
