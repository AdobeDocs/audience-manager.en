# Test Group Reporting

The test group reporting section returns information on test group conversions, allowing an easy comparison of test segment efficacy. Numerous filters and dimensions are available for data visualization.


##  {#section_FF173F7138C84C87B8BAB11BA94879DA}



[!UICONTROL Audience Lab] returns detailed reporting information for the test segments you created and allows you to save the reporting data as CSV files. You can select between **[!UICONTROL Aggregate Reporting]** and **[!UICONTROL Trend Reporting]**. **[!UICONTROL]** 


**[!UICONTROL Aggregate Reporting]** returns the absolute numbers for your test segments. **[!UICONTROL Trend Reporting]** returns a graph of the trend *over a specific period*. Four tabs enable you to customize the reports: 




<table id="table_446384AE9A36408A9C570CB7DB72C3D6"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Parameter </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Description </th>

 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p> <span class="uicontrol"> Population Conversion Rate</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Returns the percentage of devices belonging to a particular test segment, which have converted. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p> <span class="uicontrol"> Converters</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> Returns the number of devices that have exhibited the conversion trait(s) selected in the test groups. </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p> <span class="uicontrol"> Total Conversions</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Returns the number of conversions generated by the test segments. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p> <span class="uicontrol"> Test Segment Populations</span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Returns the number of devices belonging to the test segments. Toggle between <span class="uicontrol"> Total Population</span> or <span class="uicontrol"> Real-time Population</span>. The difference is explained in the <a href="../../faq/faq-reporting.md#concept_8722EA8154E1416CB334FF37E2E955C4" format="dita" scope="local"> Reporting FAQ</a> </p> . </td>

You can select a specific conversion trait for which to generate the report or you can select all traits combined. You can define a date range for which the information should be returned and export the report as a CSV file. 



>[!NOTE]

>* Reporting for a test group will populate the day after its start date.>
>* A conversion is only counted for a device after the start date of a test and after the device has been added to a test segment. If a conversion happens for that device before it is assigned a test group, the conversion will not be counted.>
