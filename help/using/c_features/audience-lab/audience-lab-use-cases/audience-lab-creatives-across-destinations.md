# Testing Creatives Across Destinations


>1. [ Create a Segment Test Group](../../../c_features/audience-lab/create-test-group.md#task_B62EF6D2992941FAAEA84BE2EA11A55E), selecting the segment you want to test the creative against as the baseline segment.
>1. Split the baseline segment into test segments and control segments.
>1. Map the test segments to the different destinations you wish to test.
>1. The control segment can be withheld and not mapped to any destination. The control segment should not be targeted by the test creative to set a results baseline for naturally occurring conversions.
>1. Specify a start date and an end date for the test.
>1. Set up the segment and the creative in the destinations.
>1. The [ Audience Lab reporting view](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/audience-lab-reporting-view.html) will show the number of conversions the creative is driving across the destinations.
>1. Because you created a control segment, you can also evaluate how the creative did against naturally occurring conversions. You are testing the question: "Did this creative generate a higher conversion rate than normal practices?"
