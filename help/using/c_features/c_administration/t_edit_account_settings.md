# Edit Your Account Settings

Admin users can create users and add them to groups for permission purposes, as explained in [ Create Users](../../c_features/c_administration/t_create_users.md#task_89D190BA6A394B719A35CDA76899B957) and [ Create a Group](../../c_features/c_administration/t_create_groups.md#task_3327F7C4A9834F1BA5007EDA279D40F2).
