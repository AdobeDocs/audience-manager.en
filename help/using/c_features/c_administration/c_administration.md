# Administration

Enterprise customers using Audience Manager need one data management platform for all of their data, but must be able to control the visibility of the different data elements to specific business units. You can accomplish this using group permissions, also referred to as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). 

Audience Manager uses groups to assign permissions. Permissions are not assigned at the user level. Group permissions are tied to objects (traits, segments, etc.) and to actions you can perform on those objects (edit, view, etc.).
