# Understanding Wild Card Permissions

Wild Card Permissions give group members automatic access to each data source associated to a segment, destination, or trait. By comparison, regular permissions only lets you assign specific data sources to the one of these objects. And, when you add new data sources, group members don't get access to those new sources. You have to open the group permissions and assign those new data sources to the group. Wild Card Permissions let you avoid this manual data source update process. Groups with Wild Card permissions get access to new data sources without explicit authorization.
