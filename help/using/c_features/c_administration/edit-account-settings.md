# Edit Your Account Settings

Non-admin users can edit their own profiles, including changing their email addresses and resetting their passwords.

<!-- t_edit_account_settings.xml -->

Admin users can create users and add them to groups for permission purposes, as explained in [Create Users](../../c_features/c_administration/administration-overview.md#task_89D190BA6A394B719A35CDA76899B957) and [Create a Group](../../c_features/c_administration/administration-overview.md#task_3327F7C4A9834F1BA5007EDA279D40F2). 

1. In the Audience Manager header, click  ![](assets/icon_profile.png).
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Account Settings]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** to display the [!UICONTROL My Account] page.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Email Address]** field, specify your new email address, if necessary.

   Audience Manager does not send regular notification to users. Audience Manager administrators have access to users' email addresses and can manually email users as needed. For example, if a user forgets his or her password, the email address specified in this field is used to send a temporary password and instructions to reset the password. 
1. To reset your password, specify your current password, specify the new password, then confirm the new password.

   See also, [Password Requirements, Locked Accounts, and Forgotten Passwords](../../reference/password-requirements.md#concept_0B501857C23944DCAE4875D3F9455F5F). 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
