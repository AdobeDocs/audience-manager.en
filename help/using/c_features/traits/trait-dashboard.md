# Traits Dashboard

The Traits dashboard is a centralized workspace for managing traits.



The [!UICONTROL Traits] dashboard contains features and tools that help you: 



1. 

   See all your traits and related details in a table with columns you can sort. 

1. 

   Review and work with [Active Audience Traits and Data Source Synced Traits](../../c_features/traits/client-activity-synced-audience-traits.md#concept_7D3F4AF1FAD440509956632B8A51E64D). 

1. 

   Create, edit, and delete traits. 

1. 

   View and manage trait storage folders. 

1. 

   Search for traits by name, ID, description or data source. Click on a folder while searching to limit results to that folder and its subfolders. 

1. 

   Filter traits by trait type (onboarded, rules-based, algorithmic, folder traits).
