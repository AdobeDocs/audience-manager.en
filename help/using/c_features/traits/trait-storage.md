**Purpose of Trait Storage Folders** 


In [!UICONTROL Trait Builder], trait storage folders are directories that hold and organize traits into logical groups that you create. Access the storage folders from the [!UICONTROL Traits] dashboard or when creating a new trait. Remember, you cannot create a new trait without assigning it to a storage folder.
