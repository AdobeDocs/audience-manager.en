# About Trait Builder

Trait Builder is a feature that improves upon traditional pixel-based data collection and audience creation/segmentation processes. It works by processing page data with server-side rules you create in the user interface.



Compared to pixels, which fire in response to simple "yes" or "true" conditions, [!UICONTROL Trait Builder] lets you: 
* Collect *all* page data so you can use it later to build relevant, useful traits.
* Build traits based on [key-value pairs](../../reference/key-value-pairs-explained.md#concept_E4236E003076483AA939791FE2492B49) passed in during data collection.
* Evaluate complex data conditions with server-side rules that work with [Boolean expressions](../../reference/boolean-expressions-tsb.md#concept_B7537516B5D04CEBB9CFB4F4B780630F) and [comparison operators](../../c_features/traits/trait-comparison-operators.md#concept_1A1761AA403341D7B91C0E26DC4294F4).
* Reduce or eliminate the need to maintain data collection pixels on your inventory.
* Monitor performance with [!DNL Audience Manager] reports.
