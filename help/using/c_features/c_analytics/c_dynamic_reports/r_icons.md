<a id="section_050E2A1E537E45188E6ED7F906730E6F"></a>

**Data Icons and Tools** 

The following icons-tools are available at the bottom of each dynamic report window. The following illustration provides more information about these tools.

**Export Data** 

This tools lets you export data from the report in 4 different formats. 

|  Export Option  | Exports Data  |
|---|---|
| **Image** | As an image (.png) file. Useful when you want to download and share report data in its original, graphical format.  |
| **PDF** | As a PDF file.  |
| **Data** | In a new browser window as numeric data in columns and rows.  |
| **Crosstab** | As a .csv file.  |

**Revert Changes** 

Select this tool to undo any interactive click changes you may have performed on the report. 

**Automatic Updates** 

The [!UICONTROL  Delivery-Performance] and [!UICONTROL  Trait-to-Trait Overlap] reports are dynamic reports that respond and change based on user click actions. For example, say you want to select several advertisers in the Overlap report. When enabled, automatic updates will start to return data as soon as you select a checkbox. This dynamic behavior can interrupt your workflow because you have to wait until the report finishes processing before selecting another advertiser. Use this tool to turn that feature off (and on again) as required. 

**Refresh Data** 

Click the refresh icon to run a report or reload your data set. When automatic updates are off, click refresh to run or update the report. 

**Search** 

Search is represented by a generic magnifying glass icon (not shown). The search field is hidden until you click on the selection labels on the left side of the screen. The table below describes the location of the search tool for each report. 

|  Report  | To find search, hover over  |
|---|---|
| [!UICONTROL  Delivery and Performance] report  | The "Advertiser Name" label.  |
|  Overlap reports  | The "SID Name" label.  |
