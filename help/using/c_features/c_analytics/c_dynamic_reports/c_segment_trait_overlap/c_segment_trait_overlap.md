# Segment-to-Trait Overlap Report

**Overview** 

As an optimization tool, the Segment to Trait Overlap reports helps you build highly focused segments or expand segment reach. For example, you can create focused segments and traits with high overlap to reach a particular audience. However, a lot of overlap may mean fewer unique users (less reach). Running this report to help expand reach by removing traits with a lot of segment overlap and replacing them with traits that have less overlap.
