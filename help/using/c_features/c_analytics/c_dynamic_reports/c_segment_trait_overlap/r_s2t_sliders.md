# Understanding the Data Filters in the Segment-to-Trait Overlap Report


>The [!UICONTROL  Segment-to-Trait overlap] report lets you use two sliders to filter data by the overlap % by trait or segment. 
>
>* **[!UICONTROL  Filter Trait Uniques %:]** Filters data by the % of unique visitors shared between the trait and the segment.
>* **[!UICONTROL  Filter Segment Uniques Overlap %:]** Filters data by the % of unique visitors share between the segment and the trait.
>**Example** 

>The following diagram illustrates the difference between the trait uniques % and the segment uniques %. In this case, the trait and segment share 3 unique visitors. As proportions: >
>* The trait shares 30% of its unique visitors with the segment (3/10 = 0.30).
>* The segment shares 0.3% of its unique visitors with the trait (3/1,000 = 0.003)
