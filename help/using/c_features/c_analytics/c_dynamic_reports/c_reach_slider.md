# Filter Report Results With the Data Sliders

**Set a Lower/Upper Range for Report Results With the Data Sliders** 

The report sliders let you set limits on the data returned by an interactive report. Move the left slider to exclude data below a specific value. Move the right slider to exclude data above a specific value. The report updates and returns data that falls within the desired range. Use the sliders to: 
* Reduce the overall amount of data returned by the reports.
* Focus on traits or segments that fall within a particular size range.
