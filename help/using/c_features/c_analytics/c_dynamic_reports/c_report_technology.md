# Report Technology

**Interactive Reports Use Tableau Technology** 

Audience Manager uses [ Tableau](http://www.tableausoftware.com/) software to display data in the interactive reports. With Tableau, the Delivery and Overlap reports use visual cues and symbols that help you: 
* Find high and low performance traits.
* Spot traits and segments with low and high unique visitor overlap.
* Use overlap data to build targeted segments.
* Expand reach by identifying related traits with low overlap.


**Data Update Schedule** 

Report data is updated weekly each Sunday. The update processes data from Saturday (the day before) back to the previous Sunday.
