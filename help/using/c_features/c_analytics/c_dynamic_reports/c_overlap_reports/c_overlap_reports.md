# Trait-to-Trait Overlap Report

**Overview** 

The [!UICONTROL  Trait-to-Trait Overlap] report returns data on the % of unique users shared between all your own traits and your third-party traits. As an optimization tool, this report helps you: 

* Create segments with high or low overlap, depending on your needs. Traits with high overlap give you a targeted audience, but fewer unique visitors. Traits with low overlap can be useful to reach a larger, unique visitor set.
* Validate third-party trait data: Strong overlap between similar first and third-party traits suggests that the trait from your data partner is accurate and trustworthy. Conversely, low overlap can indicate that a third-party trait may not actually contain the same information as your own, similar first-party trait.
* Find unexpected overlap between traits and use that information to build innovative segments.
