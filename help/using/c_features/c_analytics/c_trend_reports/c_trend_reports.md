# Trend Reports

[!DNL  Audience Manager] uses Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to extend user-group permissions to the [!UICONTROL  Trend] reports. Users can see only those traits and segments in reporting that they have permissions to view. RBAC functionality lets you control what reporting data internal teams are able to view. For example, an agency that manages different advertiser accounts can configure user-group permissions so that a team that manages Advertiser A's account cannot see Advertiser B's reporting data. 

Run a [!UICONTROL  Trend] report when you need to: 
* Review trend data by traits and segments.
* Track trends by 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90-day intervals.
* Compare trait and segment trends over time.
* Identify strong or poor performance traits and segments.
* Export data (.csv format) for further analysis and sharing.


The following illustration provides a high-level overview of key elements in the [!UICONTROL  Trend] report.
