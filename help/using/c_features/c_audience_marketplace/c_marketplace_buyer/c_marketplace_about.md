description: The Marketplace is an Audience Marketplace feature for data buyers that lists data feeds you can subscribe to. It lists flat rate, CPM, or private data feeds. These feeds are provided by third-party vendors that use Audience Manager to sell data. In the Marketplace, reporting tools let you track feed usage and the overlap between your traits and those in a subscribed data feed. Finally, with Audience Marketplace, Adobe takes care of invoices and fee payments (though you do have to self-report usage when subscribed to a CPM feed). These features let you find effective data sources without wasting time looking for a data provider.
