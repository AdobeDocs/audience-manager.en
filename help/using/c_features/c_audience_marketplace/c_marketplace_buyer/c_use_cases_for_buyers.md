# Understanding Data Feed Use Cases


## Make Comparisons with Segments and Overlap Plans {#section_162755B0AF3E4604BF579920D364ECD9}

**Segments and Overlap** 

This use case lets you compare your traits with provider traits in a[ trait-to-trait overlap report.](../../../c_features/c_analytics/c_dynamic_reports/c_overlap_reports/c_overlap_reports.md#concept_1FBAED029FFD4AA5A5C6E79F633D9A0D) Also, you can create or add provider traits to a segment and make additional comparisons with the [ segment-to-trait](../../../c_features/c_analytics/c_dynamic_reports/c_segment_trait_overlap/c_segment_trait_overlap.md#concept_36186B1ABEA34A6AAC7F5CF938A122B7) and[ segment-to-segment](../../../c_features/c_analytics/c_dynamic_reports/c_segment_segment_overlap/c_segment_segment_overlap.md#concept_25E40808056B451BA06502A9527A55AA) reports. Overlap comparisons can help you: 

* **Extend audience reach:** Low overlap suggests your traits contain users you have not seen before. You may want these traits to try and reach new users.
* **Enhance existing audiences:** High overlap suggests your traits are similar to those owned by the data provider. You may want these traits to help make targeted, incremental improvements to an already developed audience.
**Algorithmic Models** 

This use case lets you evaluate supplier traits against your traits with [ algorithmic modeling](../../../c_features/c_models/understanding-models.md#concept_441E566718B845929880B0823A9ECA9F). For example, our algorithmic modeling system uses one of your traits as a basis for comparison against a supplier trait. When the model runs, it can show if audiences in supplier traits share similar conversion attributes to your traits. 

**Activation** 

This use case lets you send data to a [ destination](../../../c_features/c_destinations/c_destinations.md#concept_5BDA346C376C4B719EA394108AB2735A). In [!UICONTROL  Audience Manager], a destination is any third-party system (ad server, DSP, DMP, exchange, etc.) that you want to share data with. However, with an [!UICONTROL  Activation] use case, you cannot run overlap reports or test the data in an algorithmic model.
