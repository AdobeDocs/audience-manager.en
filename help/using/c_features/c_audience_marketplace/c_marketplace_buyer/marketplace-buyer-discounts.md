## Review Discounted Feeds {#section_2D0DBBCB217748CBA33A9B087A936095}

To review your discounted feeds: 

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL  Audience Marketplace > Marketplace]**.
1. Click the name of a feed you're already subscribed to.
1. Look at the [!UICONTROL  Price] and [!UICONTROL  Your Price] columns in the [!UICONTROL  Plan Details] table. If the feed is discounted: 
    * The original price is marked with a red line.
    * The fee in the [!UICONTROL  Your Price] column will be lower than the fee in the [!UICONTROL  Price] column.

In the example, the buyer gets a 10% discount on the [!UICONTROL  Segments and Overlap] plan in the Software Audience Feed.
