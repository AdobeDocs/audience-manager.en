# Destinations


## Purpose and Advantages {#section_D26ED9B4C55F4FAF9406C518ED41C5E6}

Destinations and Destination Builder lets you create destinations and send information about segmented users to your data partner. This helps you: 

* **Protect data value:** Rather than send all user data to a destination, Destination Builder let you share specific information about qualified users only.
* **Take action on your data:** Sending data to a destination partner helps them quickly develop and target qualified audience segments.
* **Reduce technical overhead:** Business users can set up destinations safely in the Destination Builder interface. This helps reduce the time required for pre-deployment testing. With Destination Builder, you create, manage, and delete destinations as your business needs change, all without working through a long development cycle.
