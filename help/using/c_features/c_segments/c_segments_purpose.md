# Segments: Purpose, Composition, and Rules

**Purpose of Segments** 

A *` segment`* (or an *` audience`*) is a set of users who share common attributes. In Audience Manager, you create segments with server-side rules. These rules let you build audience groups based on site visitor attributes such as: 


* Behavior.
* Demographics (age, gender, income, etc.).
* Other characteristics you can define in the user interface.


**Segment Composition** 

An Audience Manager segment is a server-side rule that consists of individual or groups of traits. Traits are composed of data elements called key-value pairs. Along with rules you set at the segment level, these key-value pairs contain the criteria that qualify visitors for trait and segment membership. 

**Create Rules-based Segments With Segment Builder** 

Unlike traditional pixels that fire in response to simple yes/no conditions, Segment Builder lets you create complex segment requirements. Like traits, segments evaluate data using Boolean expressions (AND, OR, NOT), comparison operators (greater than, less than, equal to, etc.), and recency/frequency criteria. These features help create focused audience segments relevant to your business needs. 

**Benefits** 

Segments improve upon standard pixel-based audience creation/segmentation processes because they let you: 


* Build relevant, useful segments with first and third-party traits.
* Create sophisticated and complex segmentation rules with Boolean operators, comparison expressions, and recency/frequency criteria.
* Send segment data to a destination partner.
* Monitor performance with Audience Manager reports.
