# Segment Summary View

The segment summary page displays details such as name, traits in the segment, rules, performance data, and destination mapping information.

Click a segment name from the main dashboard to access its summary page. Summary sections include:

1. **Basic Information:** Shows required and optional details specified when the segment was created. 
1. **Segment Graph:** Displays performance data graphically and for fixed 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90-day and segment lifetime intervals. We explain segment population numbers in a [separate document](../../c_features/c_segments/segment-builder-data.md#concept_05EE3010E67F446E8818351292EF7372). 

1. **Segment Rules:** Lists traits in the segment along with qualification rules. 
1. **Destination Mappings:** Lists destination mappings for the segment. 
1. **Management Tools:** Controls that let you create, edit, clone, and delete segments.
