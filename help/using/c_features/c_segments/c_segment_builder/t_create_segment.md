# Create a Segment

**Segment Builder Section** 

Segment Builder consists of 3 separate sections: Basic Information, Traits, and Destinations Mapping. To create a segment, complete the required fields in the Basic Information and Traits sections. Destinations Mapping settings are optional. See the instructions below for additional help. 

>1. In the [ Basic Information](../../../c_features/c_segments/c_segment_builder/r_segment_basic_info_section.md#reference_9FC34B07E1944CE5A23974B8E58B2A18) section

>    
>    * Name the segment. The maximum length of a segment name is 255 characters. 

>    * Set the segment status (active is default). 

>    * Choose a data source. 

>    * Select a profile merge rule to use for segment qualification. 

>    * Assign the segment to a storage folder. 

>1. In the [ Traits](../../../c_features/c_segments/c_segment_builder/r_segment_traits_section.md#reference_131791CC12A6431A8AD5F19F4FB48947) section

>    
>    * Search for the trait you want to add to a segment and click **[!UICONTROL  Add Trait]**. Add another trait to create a trait group. 

>    * Bring up the Advanced Search modal by clicking **[!UICONTROL  Browse All Traits]**. Search for traits by name, ID, description or data source. Click on a folder while searching to limit results to that folder and its subfolders. You can also filter traits by trait type. 

>    * Click and drag traits to create separate groups. 

>    * Hover between groups to set relationships with Boolean AND, OR, AND NOT values. 

>    * Hover over the clock icon to add [ recency and frequency](../../../c_features/c_segments/c_segment_builder/c_recency_frequency.md#concept_957D9E1977774D28A98ACEE6035E7B37) rules to the trait. 

>    * View segment population data as you add or remove traits. Click **[!UICONTROL  Calculate Estimates]** to see (or refresh) the estimated population numbers. Read more about [ segment population data](../../../c_features/c_segments/segment-builder-data.md#section_ED9F6B29E9D541499E3FC7C0A1753FCE) in the Segment Builder. 

>    * Click **[!UICONTROL  Save]** when done. 

>1. *(Optional)* Map a segment to a destination in the [ Destination Mapping](../../../c_features/c_segments/c_segment_builder/r_segment_destinations_map/r_segment_destinations_map.md#reference_D4D92F9F114449C9BC2A51A1C746D92F) section

>    
>    * Search for the destination and click **[!UICONTROL  Add Destination]**. Note, the destination must already exist before you can add it to a segment. 

>    * Click **[!UICONTROL  Save]** when done.
