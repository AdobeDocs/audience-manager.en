# Segments: Purpose, Composition, and Rules

Describes segments, their constituent parts, and rule creation with Segment Builder.

 **Purpose of Segments**

A *`segment`* (or an *`audience`*) is a set of users who share common attributes. In Audience Manager, you create segments with server-side rules. These rules let you build audience groups based on site visitor attributes such as:

* Behavior. 
* Demographics (age, gender, income, etc.). 
* Other characteristics you can define in the user interface.

**Segment Composition**

An Audience Manager segment is a server-side rule that consists of individual or groups of traits. Traits are composed of data elements called key-value pairs. Along with rules you set at the segment level, these key-value pairs contain the criteria that qualify visitors for trait and segment membership.

>[!TIP]
>
>Audience Manager segments are different from Adobe Analytics segments. Read [Understanding Segments in Analytics and Audience Manager](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/audiences/aam-analytics-segments.html) for an in-depth description of the differences.

**Create Rules-based Segments With Segment Builder**

Unlike traditional pixels that fire in response to simple yes/no conditions, Segment Builder lets you create complex segment requirements. Like traits, segments evaluate data using Boolean expressions (AND, OR, NOT), comparison operators (greater than, less than, equal to, etc.), and recency/frequency criteria. These features help create focused audience segments relevant to your business needs.

**Benefits**

Segments improve upon standard pixel-based audience creation/segmentation processes because they let you:

* Build relevant, useful segments with first and third-party traits. 
* Create sophisticated and complex segmentation rules with Boolean operators, comparison expressions, and recency/frequency criteria. 
* Send segment data to a destination partner. 
* Monitor performance with Audience Manager reports.
