<wintitle>
  Marketplace
</wintitle>, reporting tools let you track feed usage and the overlap between your traits and those in a subscribed data feed. Finally, with 
<wintitle>
  Audience Marketplace

The [!UICONTROL Marketplace] list contains information that you can sort and search to find the data feed that's right for you. Items in the [!UICONTROL Marketplace] buyer's list include: 



* **Search:** Find data feeds by name or text description.
* **Name:** Name of the data feed.
* **Description:** Information about the contents of a data feed.
* **Provider:** Name of the data provider.
* **Traits:** The number of traits in a data feed.
* **30 Day Uniques:** The number of unique users seen in the last 30 days.
* **30 Day Overlapped Uniques:** The number of users in your account that overlap with the users in the providerâ€™s account. The % value is calculated as (30-day Overlapped Uniques/Provider's total 30-day uniques) x 100.
* **Private Feeds:** See [Private Data Feeds](../../../c_features/audience-marketplace/marketplace-private-feeds.md#concept_68EDE94B558C4B88BBCC994B67726FD2)
* **Currently Subscribed Plan Count:** The number of subscriptions you have with a data provider.




## Private Data Feeds {#section_FF7054C8EF3D4BC8A005FACBDFFB3AC1}



In the [!UICONTROL Marketplace] list, sometimes the provider's name and trait data are marked as private. This indicates a [private data feed](../../../c_features/audience-marketplace/marketplace-private-feeds.md#concept_68EDE94B558C4B88BBCC994B67726FD2). A private data feed lets sellers limit buyer access to their data. Sellers can make feeds private when they're offering special deals, discounts, or when privacy and access control are important to them. As a buyer, you have to send a subscription request to the seller if you want access to a private feed. See [Subscribe to a Private Data Feed](../../../c_features/audience-marketplace/marketplace-data-buyers/marketplace-manage-subscriptions.md#task_201526273485445EB6DB0FAD196259C5) for details.
