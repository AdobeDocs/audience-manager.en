# Trait Storage

**Purpose of Trait Storage Folders** 

In Trait Builder, trait storage folders are directories that hold and organize traits into logical groups that you create. Access the storage folders from the [!UICONTROL  Traits] dashboard or when creating a new trait. Remember, you cannot create a new trait without assigning it to a storage folder.
