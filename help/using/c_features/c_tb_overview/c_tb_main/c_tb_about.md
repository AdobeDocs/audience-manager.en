# About Trait Builder

Compared to pixels, which fire in response to simple "yes" or "true" conditions, Trait Builder lets you: 
* Collect *all* page data so you can use it later to build relevant, useful traits.
* Build traits based on [ key-value pairs](../../../c_reference/c_key_value_explained.md#concept_E4236E003076483AA939791FE2492B49) passed in during data collection.
* Evaluate complex data conditions with server-side rules that work with [ Boolean expressions](../../../c_reference/c_tb_boolean.md#concept_B7537516B5D04CEBB9CFB4F4B780630F) and [ comparison operators](../../../c_features/c_tb_overview/c_tb_reference/c_tb_comparison_operators.md#concept_1A1761AA403341D7B91C0E26DC4294F4).
* Reduce or eliminate the need to maintain data collection pixels on your inventory.
* Monitor performance with Audience Manager reports.
