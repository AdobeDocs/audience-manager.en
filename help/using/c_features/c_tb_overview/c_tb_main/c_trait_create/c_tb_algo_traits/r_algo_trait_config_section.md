# Configuration Settings for Algorithmic Traits


>**Prerequisites:**>
>* [ Create an algorithmic model](../../../../../c_features/c_models/c_model_builder/t_model_build.md#task_71541056B8384EEBB6A3A8B161C71B8A).
>* Wait for the notification email that lets you know the model data run has finished.
>* Complete the required fields in the [ Basic Information](../../../../../c_features/c_tb_overview/c_tb_main/c_trait_create/c_tb_basics.md#concept_D80233EF56764376B0F4C4FF882BAD2E) section.
>**Configuration Fields and Settings** 



>|  Interface Element  | Explanation  |
>|---|---|
>|  **Select Model for Algorithmic Trait** |Click the **[!UICONTROL  Update]** button to open the models window. From the window, select the algorithmic model that you want to use to create the trait.  |
>|  **Select Goal Accuracy** | Select this option to create a trait based on accuracy. Accuracy is a scored value that indicates how close potential users are to your baseline. The accuracy scale ranges from 0 (least accurate) to 1 (most accurate).  |
>|  **Reach and Accuracy Data Columns** | Located on the right, this section displays up to 21 rows of numeric data that displays the accuracy and reach values for your model.  |
>|  **Reach and Accuracy Slider** | Located at the bottom of the graph, the slider lets you set a numeric value for your reach or accuracy goals. You can set the slider and then choose the reach or accuracy goal button to create a trait.  |
