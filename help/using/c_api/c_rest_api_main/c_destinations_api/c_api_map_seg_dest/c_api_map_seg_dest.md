# Map Segments to a Destination

**Supported Destination Types: URL and Cookie Only** 

The available ` POST` methods let you map segments to URL and cookie destinations only. Currently, you cannot map segments to server-to-server destinations with these REST API methods. Use the user interface instead. However, the related destination ` GET` methods let you retrieve information about server-to-server destinations created in the user interface.
