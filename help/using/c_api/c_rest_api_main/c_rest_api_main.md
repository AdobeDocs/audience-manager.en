# REST APIs

The Audience Manager REST API follows JavaScript Object Notation ([ JSON](http://www.json.org/)) standards for formatting sent and received data. A principal advantage of JSON is that it helps make API queries easy to write, read, and parse by developers and machines. 

Review the [ Getting Started](../../c_api/c_rest_api_main/c_rest_api_overview/c_rest_api_overview.md#concept_2745BC64D5BD43A49DA6020E42280863) material before working with these API methods.
