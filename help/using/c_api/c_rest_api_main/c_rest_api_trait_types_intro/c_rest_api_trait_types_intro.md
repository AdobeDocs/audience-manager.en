# Trait Type Methods


>[!NOTE]
>
>Trait type methods do not assign traits to categories used by the[ common taxonomy ](../../../c_api/c_rest_api_main/c_rest_api_taxonomy/c_rest_api_taxonomy.md#concept_A3A8F6F90394453AB0D16F692479D45B). Think of these as labels that are separate from the common taxonomy. 



For visual reference, [!UICONTROL  Trait Types] is a dropdown control located in the UI under **[!UICONTROL  Traits > Create new trait > Basic Information]**.
