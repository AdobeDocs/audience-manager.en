# Getting Started With Class-level DIL APIs

When working with the class-level DIL APIs: 
* Access requires a partner name and container namespace ID (NSID). Contact your Audience Manager account manager to obtain this information.
* Replace any sample *italicized* text in the API documentation with value, ID, or other variable as required by the method you're working with.
* DIL writes encoded data to a destination cookie. For example, spaces are encoded as ` %20` and semicolons as ` %3B`.
