# Flash DIL

Flash DIL is an ActionScript code library that lets you work with video playback data in Audience Manager. Flash DIL works by capturing SWF content the Adobe AppMeasurement library passes in to Analytics. Flash DIL sends that data to the separate DIL JavaScript data collection module, which passes that information to Audience Manager. Analytics data (Props, eVars, events, etc.) captured from the FLA file is available in Audience Manager as traits or unused signals.
