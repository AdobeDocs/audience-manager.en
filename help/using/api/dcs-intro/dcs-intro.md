# Data Collection Server (DCS) API Methods and Code

Code, methods, and techniques that let you work programmatically with the Audience Manager Data Collection Servers (DCS).

* [DCS Event Call APIs](/help/using/api/dcs-intro/dcs-event-calls/dcs-event-calls.md)

  If company policies or other technical issues prevent you from placing our JavaScript code on your pages, you can still work with Audience Manager to send and return data from DCS with these event call APIs.

* [DCS APIs for Server-to-Server Data Transfers](/help/using/api/dcs-intro/dcs-s2s/dcs-s2s.md)

  Server-to-server (S2S) APIs provide code and methods that let you send and receive DCS user data and work with this information in your own systems or applications.

* [DCS API Reference](/help/using/api/dcs-intro/dcs-api-reference/dcs-api-methods.md)

  Conceptual information, descriptions, and definitions for DCS API code, methods, and processes.
