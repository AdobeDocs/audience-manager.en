Your queries will work if you send them to the wrong DCS, but these calls are inefficient and can delay the response. To make a DCS request, match the region ID to its corresponding regional host name and form your query with the proper host name.

# DCS Region IDs, Locations, and Host Names {#dcs-region-ids-locations-and-host-names}

The regional [!DNL DCS] server host name is required to make calls to the [!DNL DCS]. This is because the [!DNL DCS] stores information in data centers that are geographically close to site visitors. Your queries will work if you send them to the wrong [!DNL DCS], but these calls are inefficient and can delay the response. To make a [!DNL DCS] request, match the region ID to its corresponding regional host name and form your query with the proper host name.
