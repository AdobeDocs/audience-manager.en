## Profile Retrieval Error Codes {#profile-retrieval-error-codes}

| Code ID | Message | Description |
|--- |--- |--- |
|200|Cannot read traits from profile cache for id: *`ID`*|Returned when a user profile cannot be read from our internal storage.|
|201|Cannot read device ids from profile cache for customer id: *`ID`*|Returned when the [device ID](../../../reference/ids-in-aam.md#reference_D55EC67D86664B7499F3257BB870FEC8) cannot be retrieved for a Profile Link merge rule.|
|202|Cannot read related customer for device id: *`ID`*|Returned when the [customer ID (UUID)](../../../reference/ids-in-aam.md#reference_D55EC67D86664B7499F3257BB870FEC8) associated to a device ID cannot be retrieved for a Last Authenticated merge rule from our internal storage.|
|203|Cannot read device cluster for id: *`ID`*|The linked device IDs from the same device graph cluster cannot be returned for this device ID.|
|204|Could not perform migration since profile read failed for primary device|If you receive this error, we may be experiencing scalability issues with our data store ([!UICONTROL PCS]). Contact your Adobe representative if the problem persists.|
|205|Could not perform migration from *`ID`* to *`ID`*, because profile read failed for *`ID`*|If you receive this error, we may be experiencing scalability issues with our data store ([!UICONTROL PCS]). Contact your Adobe representative if the problem persists.|

## Integration Warning Codes {#integration-warning-codes}

| Code ID | Message | Description |
|--- |--- |--- |
|300|Invalid customer id *`ID`*|The customer ID is invalid (missing values for data source, missing integration codes, invalid format for data sources, blocked customer ID, blank customer ID, unauthorized access attempt to a data source that does not belong to the partner).|
|301|Maximum number of customer ids exceeded. Maximum allowed is *`maximum allowed`*. Found is *`maximum found`*.|The number of customer IDs associated with a cross-device data source exceed the allowed number of cross-device IDs per request. These IDs include cross device, mobile, or cookie IDs. The limit is currently set to 10.|
|302|Unauthorized customer id *`ID`*|Returned when the customer ID data source is not owned by the current Organization ID. If you do not know or have your Organization ID, see the "Find your Organization ID" section in [ Organizations and Account Linking](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcloud/organizations.html) for information about how to find it.|
|303|Blocked customer id *`ID`*|Returned when the customer ID has been identified as malicious and has been blacklisted.|
|304|Blocked datasource id *`ID`*|Returned when the data source ID has been identified as malicious and has been blacklisted.|
|306|Blocked declared device id *`ID`*|The device ID has been identified as malicious and has been blacklisted. This can happen when we receive an extreme amount of [!UICONTROL DCS] requests containing this device ID in a short amount of time.|
|307|Blocked profile operation for *`ID`*|A read/write action has been blocked because an ID has been identified as malicious and has been blacklisted. See error code 306.|
|309|Customer id *`ID`* was discarded because it exceeded the limit of declared customer ids per request|Related to error 301. This error specifies which customer ID was discarded because the limit was exceeded. <br>For example, If there are 12 customer IDs declared on the [!UICONTROL DCS] call, two of them will be discarded. In order to relay which ones were discarded, this error will appear twice in the response (once for each of discarded customer ID ).|
|310|Customer id was discarded because it exceeded the limit for a given namespace. Namespace id is *`ID`*, customer id is *`ID`*.|This error code is returned if there are more than 3 customer IDs declared for the same namespace (` DPID`) on a [!UICONTROL DCS] call. <br>`https://partner.demdex.net/event?d_rtbd=json&d_cid_ic=one&d_cid_ic=one&d_cid_ic=one&d_cid_ic=one` <br>In this sample [!UICONTROL DCS] request, there are 4 ids declared for the same namespace (with the integration code one). One of the IDs is discarded and error 310 is returned.|
|311|Request contains invalid parameters|The [!UICONTROL DCS] returns this error code when at least one URL parameter is not properly encoded. In this case, the [!UICONTROL DCS] disregards the entire request. <br>`http(s)://partner.demdex.net/event?d_event=imp&d_rtbd=json&d_src=38454&d_site=%esid!&d_creative=%ecid!&d_adgroup=%eaid!&d_placement=%epid!&d_campaign=%ebuy!&d_adsrc=48123`<br>In the sample request above, the `%` sequence is incorrectly encoded. Consequently, the [!UICONTROL DCS] will disregard it.  The correctly encoded sample should look like this: <br>`http(s)://partner.demdex.net/event?d_event=imp&d_rtbd=json&d_src=38454&d_site=%25esid!&d_creative=%25ecid!&d_adgroup=%25eaid!&d_placement=%25epid!&d_campaign=%25ebuy!&d_adsrc=48123`|
|312|Request contains an invalid Global Device ID|The [!UICONTROLDCS] returns this error code when  the request contains an invalid Global Device ID. DCS ignores the invalid ID and throws a 312 error along with the specific errors of the invalid ID. Refer to [Global Data Sources](../../../features/global-data-sources.md#topic_A083014ABB9B4D60BA69BB97EFDD97EB) and [Index of IDs in Audience Manager](../../../reference/ids-in-aam.md#reference_D55EC67D86664B7499F3257BB870FEC8) for detailed information on the correct device advertising ID formats and corresponding global data sources.<br>Example of an incorrect call: <br>`"http://partner.demdex.net/event?d_rtbd=json&d_cid=20915%01a53cc5a2-6aa1-4210-8ded-a88b29b6212z"`<br>**Explanation**: An IDFA (DPID 20915) must be an uppercase ID. The ID provided in the request is lowercase.|
