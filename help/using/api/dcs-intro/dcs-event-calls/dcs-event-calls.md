# DCS Event Call APIs {#dcs-event-call-apis}

Event calls send information to the [!UICONTROL DCS] in a [!DNL URL] string. In a typical Audience Manager deployment, customers use our [!DNL JavaScript] data collection code ([!UICONTROL DIL]) to send data to the [!UICONTROL DCS]. However, sometimes customers cannot put our [!DNL JavaScript] code on their pages. If company policies or other technical issues prevent you from placing our [!DNL JavaScript] code on your pages, you can still work with Audience Manager to send and return data from [!UICONTROL DCS] with these event call [!DNL API]s.
