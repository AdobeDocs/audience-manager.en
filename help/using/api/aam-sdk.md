# [!DNL SDK] Code {#sdk-code}

Audience Manager provides software development kits ([!DNL SDK]s) for [!DNL Android] and [!DNL iOS].

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>As of September 2018, we released a new, major version of the SDK. These new Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs are configurable through [Experience Platform Launch](https://www.adobe.com/experience-platform/launch.html).

* To get started, go to [Launch](https://launch.adobe.com/).
* To see what is in the Experience Platform SDK repositories, go to [Github: Adobe Experience Platform SDKs](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks).
* To implement Audience Manager in your app, using the new SDK v.5, read the [Adobe Audience Manager documentation](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-audience-manager) on the new SDK page.

<br>&nbsp;

We still support the Android and iOS 4.x SDKs. For those SDK code libraries, see:

* [Android SDK](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/mobile-services/android/overview.html)
* [iOS SDK](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/mobile-services/ios/overview.html)
