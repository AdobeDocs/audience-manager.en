# [!UICONTROL DCS] Event Call APIs {#dcs-event-call-apis}

However, sometimes customers cannot put our JavaScript code on their pages. If company policies or other technical issues prevent you from placing our JavaScript code on your pages, you can still work with Audience Manager to send and return data from [!UICONTROL DCS] with these event call APIs.
