RESTful APIs let you work programmatically with Audience Manager.

The Audience Manager REST API follows JavaScript Object Notation ( [JSON](https://www.json.org/)) standards for formatting sent and received data. A principal advantage of JSON is that it helps make API queries easy to write, read, and parse by developers and machines.

Review the [Getting Started](../../c-api/c-rest-api-main/aam-api-getting-started.md#concept_2745BC64D5BD43A49DA6020E42280863) material before working with these API methods.
