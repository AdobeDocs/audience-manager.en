# [!DNL REST APIs] {#rest-apis}

[!DNL RESTful APIs] let you work programmatically with Audience Manager.

The Audience Manager [!DNL REST API] follows JavaScript Object Notation ( [JSON](https://www.json.org/)) standards for formatting sent and received data. A principal advantage of JSON is that it helps make [!DNL API] queries easy to write, read, and parse by developers and machines.

Review the [Getting Started](../../c-api/c-rest-api-main/aam-api-getting-started.md#getting-started-with-rest-apis) material before working with these API methods.
