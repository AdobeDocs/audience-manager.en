# GDPR Partner Unsegment

However, some of our activation partners: 


1. Cannot support unsegment requests from Adobe and/or
1. Are not able to receive updates from us more frequently than once in 30 days.


In those cases, you are not able to send delete requests to activation partners in an automated way through Audience Manager. Download our [ Partner Excel sheet](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/downloads/AAM-Partners-July2018.xlsx) to see which Audience Manager activation partners support unsegment.
