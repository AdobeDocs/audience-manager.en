# First-Party Data Collection

Audience Manager works with clients to understand their data strategy and then maps that strategy back to a custom data-collection plan. Our Partner Solutions team works with you to evaluate sites, raw data signals, and other user interactions on your websites. With this information, weâ€™ll help you create a tailored data-collection strategy that captures user-level data signals from various pages in your inventory. Captured data is stored and mapped back to a predefined taxonomy, which can be updated at any time, as your business needs change. 

The following example illustrates how potential data elements can be captured from a sample shopping page.

After the raw data is collected, it gets mapped back to customer-defined traits within the Audience Manager platform. Both the taxonomy and data mappings can be adjusted at any time without making changes to the data collection code.
