# Second-Party Data Collection

In a second-party-data scenario, advertisers send their own data assets to publishers so they can combine that information with the publisherâ€™s data and then execute a more targeted advertising program. Furthermore, publishers can extend their audience pool by partnering with their advertisers. In most cases, these arrangements involve contractual relationships limited to putting the Audience Manager container tag on the partner site to facilitate data collection and sharing. 

An example of second-party-data collection and remarketing could involve an automobile manufacturer collecting data on its car configuration pages and then sharing this information with key partners. In this case, the car manufacturer could serve different ads across an Audience Manager partner site for consumers who configured different types of vehicle options (e.g., color, model, etc.).
