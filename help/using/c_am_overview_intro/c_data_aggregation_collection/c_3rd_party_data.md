# Third-Party Data Collection

Third-party data can be used to qualify existing data segments (for example, age, household income, and so forth), provide data that is in demand but not otherwise available, or be used in lookalike modeling against a known user base from first-party and second-party data. Audience Manager works with many third-party data providers and will help you understand the type of data these data providers collect so you can make the right strategic deals with each provider.

>For a full list of third-party data providers supported by [!DNL  Audience Manager], see the [ Adobe Exchange Marketplace](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/content/resources/en/exchange/marketplace/audience.html) (https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/content/resources/en/exchange/marketplace/audience.html). 



Audience Manager integrates with other data providers based on their available APIs and data sets. Data collection works in real-time, as a user browses your site, or via out-of-band methodologies where IDs are synchronized between partners and data is transferred between servers after a user has left your site. In either case, Audience Manager clients get the benefit of having third-party data synchronized on our platform, which means each client, or domain, does not have to perform its own synchronization. This helps increase reach and reduces server calls from the page. 

## Match Partners {#section_7B00640D332146AA96353689F4EC24C3}

Many clients choose to work with third-party data-match partners. These entities have relationships with sites that have registration requirements and can process customer data files by matching them (in real-time) based on their registration network.
