# Custom Segment Generation

You can report on historical trait and segment size as segments are created. This helps publisher team members understand potential inventory and lets them adjust segment composition based on reporting data. 
>[!NOTE]
>
>Historic segment size reporting shows actual numbers, not estimates.



Qualification begins after a segment is saved in the Audience Manager interface. Our system uses two methods that help ensure full segment coverage across a publisherâ€™s entire user base: 

* **Instant Segment Qualification:** Qualifies users based on real-time data collection processes.
* **Processed Segments:** Back-end processing of users not yet seen again who qualify based on new segment rules criteria.
