# Tag Management

Enterprise-level tag management is integral to Audience Manager. Furthermore, Audience Manager is tag agnostic. The system lets customers create, schedule, deploy, and manage their own tags. Additionally, the intuitive management interface uses conditional logic that provides flexibility when managing tags across a complex site environment. Adobe is committed to developing this platform and supporting our clients and partners. We are also working to integrate our platform into the Adobe Experience Cloud. See [ Tag Insertion Manager (TIM)](../c_features/c_tim1_about.md#concept_B824B70BF53D4F17A0CD938FF1FCF2C5) for more information.
